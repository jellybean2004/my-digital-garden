- **note:** sunspots are dark as they are *relatively cooler* that the surrounding, at a temperature of $3000-4500\,K$

- the cooler regions of enhanced magnetic field, revealed by [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/G - measurement of angular momentum/PX262 - G6b - strong-field zeeman effect\|zeeman splitting]] of absorption lines, supress convection and allow the spot to cool

- **note:** the black line on the image on the left is the light passed to the spectrograph, shown on the right, which shows the zeeman splitting

- the global magnetic field is approximately a dipole with magnetic flux loops emerging with spots at active regions

- opposite polarity is seen at either side of the spots
