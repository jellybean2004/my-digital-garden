- a mid-sized and middle-aged main sequence star
- type: $G2V$
- mass: $M_{\odot} = 1.99\times10^{30}\,kg$, measured using the orbits of planets
- radius: $R_{\odot} = 6.9\times10^{8}\,m = 109\,R_{\oplus}$, measured from the angular size and the distance from the earth to the sun $(1\,au)$

- its spectrum is close to a blackbody, with an effective temperature of $5780\,K$
$$L_{\odot} = 4\pi R_{\odot}^{2} \sigma T_{\odot} ^{4}  = 3.84\times10^{26}\,W$$
	where, $\sigma$ is the stefan-boltzmann constant
