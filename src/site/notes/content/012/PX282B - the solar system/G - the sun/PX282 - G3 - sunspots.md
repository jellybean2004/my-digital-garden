- **note:** sunspots are dark as they are *relatively cooler* that the surrounding, at a temperature of $3000-4500\,K$

- the cooler regions of enhanced magnetic field, revealed by [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/G - additional interactions/PX262 - G7b - strong-field zeeman effect\|zeeman splitting]] of absorption lines, supress convection and allow the spot to cool

- **note:** the black line on the image on the left is the light passed to the spectrograph, shown on the right, which shows the zeeman splitting

- the global magnetic field is approximately a dipole with magnetic flux loops emerging with spots at active regions
- opposite polarity is seen at either side of the spots
- the polarity is reversed either side of the equator

- a large-scale dipole field is present with higher order flux loops associated with sunspot groups
- generated by magnetic dynamo, requires bulk shearing flow in a conducting medium (and speed magnetic field)
- connects the kinetic energy to the magnetic energy
- in the sun, shearing flows from differential rotation (equator rotates faster than the poles) and at **tachocline** (the core rotates as a solid body)
