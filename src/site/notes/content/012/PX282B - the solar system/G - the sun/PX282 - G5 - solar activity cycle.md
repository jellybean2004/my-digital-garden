- the solar magnetic activity varies in an 11 year cycle
- approaching the maximum, the number of sunspots increases and they emerge closer to the equator
- the x-ray emission also increases
- the magnetic field cycles between toroidal and poloidal due to differential rotation
- this causes the magnetic field to be reversed
- this is called the **solar dynamo model**

- coronal plasma can escape along 'open field lines' as a **solar wind**
- this causes the **ion tail** of comets and can also erode planet atmospheres
- at earth, solar winds with  velocities $\sim 500\,km\,s^{-1}$, and number densities $\sim 7\times10^6\,m^{-3}$ can be seen
$$\frac{1}{2} m_{H}v_{H}^{2} \simeq \frac{3}{2} k_{B}T \implies T \approx \frac{m_{H}v_{H}^{2}}{3k_{B}} = 1.0\times10^{7}\,K$$
- this is comparable to the coronal temperatures, but an additional energy source is needed to explain this temperature
- it is believed that the winds are assisted by [**alfven waves**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfv%C3%A9n_wave) propagating along magnetic field lines excited by convection at the photosphere

## mass loss rate
- considering the mass of a thin shell in wind around the sun with a radius $r:$
$$\begin{gather*}
dm  = \rho \,dV = n_{H}m_{H}(4\pi r^{2}\,dr) \\
\implies \frac{dm}{dt}  = 4\pi r^{2} n_{H}m_{H} v  = 3\times10^{-14}\,M_{\odot}yr^{-1} 
\end{gather*}$$
- this is negligible compared to the solar mass (c.f. [[content/012/PX282A - stars/E - stellar evolution/PX282 - E5e - asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\|AGB stars]], the mass loss rate is $\sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$)
- this is still significant for the loss of angular momentum and spin is slowed down
- the wind is force to corotate with the sun, ie. the sun exerts a torque on the wind, transferring angular momentum and slowing down solar rotation
- the angular momentum:
$$J = mvr = m \frac{2\pi r}{P_{spin}} r  \implies \frac{J}{m}\propto r^{2}$$
- $J/m$ is called the **specific angular momentum**
- there is a significant **magnetic braking**
-
