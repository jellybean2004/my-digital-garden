- based on conservation of energy: energy in = energy out
- the incoming energy comes from solar radiation
- the outgoing energy comes from infrared radiation
$$(1 - a)S\,\pi R = \sigma T^{4} \,4 \pi R^{2}$$
	where, 
		$a =$ albedo,
		$S =$ solar constant $= 1366$ Wm$^{-3}$
		$R=$ radius of earth
- the LHS considers the projection of earth's surface
- the RHS comes from the [[content/011/PX156 - quantum phenomena/PX156A - quantum phenomena/PX156 - A - light/PX156 - A2 - blackbody radiation and laws\|stefan-boltzmann law]]. assuming that the earth is a blackbody


$$(1-a) \frac{S}{4} = \sigma T^{4} \tag{1}$$
	where, $a = 0.3$ (reflected radiation - ice sheets, land, oceans, clouds)
- for a completely reflective surface, $a =1$

-  the temperature of earth:
$$T = 255 \text{K}$$
- the true temperature is higher, $33\degree$C, due to greenhouse effect

- increased concentration of greenhouse gases increases the temperature of the earth

- the blackbody emission spectrum has a peak at specific wavelengths corresponding to specific effective temperatures
	- for the sun, $\lambda_{max} \approx 0.5\,\text{nm} \implies T \approx 5800\,\text{K}$
	- for the earth, $\lambda_{max} \approx 10\,\mu\text{m} \implies T \approx 288\,\text{K}$
	- 
- greenhouse gases absorb energy in the infrared range and transmit light in the visible range
