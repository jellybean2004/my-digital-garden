## mars
- it lies in the habitable zone around the sun. where liquid water can exist on the surface of a planet, and the atmospheric pressure is just enough
- imaging and sampling show that surface water was abundant in the past
- enhanced deuterium-hydrogen ratio (D/H) provides evidence of past water lost to evaporation
- there is radar evidence of liquid water lakes below ice caps
## venus
- it has no surface water, and has an extreme D/H implying extreme water loss
- possible detection of phosphine PH$_3$ might be a ***biomarker***
- liquid water droplets (in the form of sulphuric acid) do exist in clouds
## icy moons of the giants
- europa, which is resurfaced with liquid water from a tidally-heated subsurface ocean
- it has relatively low water content
- thin ocean and maybe hydrothermal vents providing nutrients

- deeper oceans on ganymede will have ice at the bottom, and probably no hydrothermal vents

- enceladus has water geysers with organic chemistry, and molecular hydrogen

- titan may have exotic life in its methane lakes
