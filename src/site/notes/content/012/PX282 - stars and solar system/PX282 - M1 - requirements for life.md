- the definitions of life are notoriously difficult and controversial, but its requirements are better understood through the study of ***extremophiles***, mainly bacteria
- eg: 
	- temperature $-20 \to 121 \degree$C (hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges)
	- ionizing radiation upto $>1000\times$ lethal dose for humans
	- chemical extremes, like pH $-0.06 \to 11$
	- pressure $>1100$ bar

- the fundamental requirements are:
	- energy source, eg: photosynthesis, chemosynthesis
	- carbon source, as its valency allows complex organic chemistry. this is also unlikely to be a limiting factor due to its abundancy
	- liquid water, which is a solvent by all all life on earth and is relatively rare in the solar system

- carbon-based life may not be the sole possibility, but H, O and C are the first, the third and the sixth most common elements
- liquid water needs moderate temperatures and pressure $\geq 0.006$ bar
- the high temperature limit is set by organic chemistry
- hydrothermal vents are favourable for life because nutrients are abundant from heated water/rocks

- fossil evidence of life on earth $\sim 3.8$ Gyr ago
- from the faint young sun paradox, it implies that liquid water must have been present
- this could be possible due to stronger greenhouse effect from higher atmospheric CO$_2$ abundance
