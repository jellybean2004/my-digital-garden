- a key aspects of stars and planets
- balance between gravity and pressure gradient
- basically, a body is massive enough that gravity can overcome its rigid body forces, and is round
- consider a shell within the planet/star with a thickness, $dr$, and a mass, $dm$, at a radius, $r$
- consider a small element within the shell having a mass, $M_{r}$ (a cylinder, with axis perpendicular to the surface, faces aligned along the surfaces of the shell)
- gravitational force, 
$$F_{G}= \frac{G\, M_{r}\, dm}{r^{2}} \tag{1}$$
	where, $dm = \rho(r)\, dr\,dA$, $\rho(r)$ is the density, $dA$ is the area of the cylinder's circular surface
- due to pressure: 
$$F_{P} = \rho(r)\,dA-\rho(r+dr)\,dA = -dP\,dA \tag{2}$$
- from equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, the **hydrostatic equilibrium equation**:
$$\frac{dP}{dr}= - \frac{G\, M_{r}\,\rho(r)}{r^{2}}$$
- can be used to solve for the interior structure of a star/planet
	- eg: $\rho(r)$, if $P(\rho)$ is known, ie: *the equation of state*
