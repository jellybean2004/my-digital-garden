- circa 1802, lines were noticed on the solar spectrum, which were labelled in 1814: $Na\,I$, $Ca\,II$, $H$, $K$
- in 1859, kirchoff and bunsen found lines in the lab, arising from transitions of electrons between energy states

- initially, stars were ranked by the strength of hydrogen lines by fleming, categorized into the draper system: $A, B, C, D,\dots Q$
- every other category varies irregularly

- cannon devised the **harvard classification scheme** based on **temperature**, dropping most of the letters except a few

- mnemonic: **O**h, **B**e **A** **F**ine **G**irl, **K**iss **M**e!

- the categories vary as follows:
	- hot & bright $\to$ cold & dim
	- blue & white $\to$ red
	- $\sim10\,R_{\odot}, >20\,M_{\odot} \to <0.7\,R_{\odot}, <0.5\,M_{\odot}$
	- short-lived ($10\,Myr$) $\to$ long-lived ($>100\,Gyr$)
- the sun is a G-type star
