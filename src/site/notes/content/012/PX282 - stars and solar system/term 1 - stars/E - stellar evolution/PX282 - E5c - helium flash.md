- this happens if the mass of a star is more than $2\,M_{\odot}$
- the core is degenerate with no regulation and runaway fusion
- He-fusion ignites core in a few seconds
- fusion is a $3\alpha$ process ($3_2^4$He $\to$ $_{6}^{12}$C)
- the energy released is comparable to a galaxy, but is mostly absorbed by outer layers
- ends when degeneracy is lifted
