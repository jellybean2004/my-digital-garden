- this is caused by the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf as its mass goes over the chandrashekhar limit through accretion
- C-burning ignites in degenerate material, without any regulation, causing a complete destruction of the white dwarf
- they are used as standard candles as the chandrashekhar mass limit is known, so all $SN Ia$ have the same luminosity
