- after exhausting He in the core, it constitutes of degenerate C and O
- there is a H burning shell around it
- they alternate in **thermal pulses**

- when He is burning, the H shell expands and cools, resulting in less H fusion
- eventually, He depletes
- the H shell reignites, drops more He on the shell below, reigniting it

- **giant convective envelope**
- dust forms , which is moved up by convection
- **super wind** occurs from envelope ejection
- $\dot M \approx 10^{-4} \,M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$

- for $M < \sim 8\,M_{\odot}$, when the envelope is lost, evolution stops
- there is a degenerate C and O core
