- consider light with an intensity, $I_\lambda$ passing through a material of thickness, $dz$
- the emergent light will have a new intensity, $I_{\lambda}'$
## absorption
- the change in specific intensity with respect to the depth due to absorption: 
$$\frac{dI_{\lambda}}{dz} = - \kappa_{\lambda} \,\rho \, I_{\lambda}$$
	where, $\rho=$ density, and $\kappa_\lambda=$ the absorption coefficient/opacity
## scattering
- the change in specific intensity with respect to the depth due to scattering: 
$$\frac{dI_{\lambda}}{dz} = - \sigma_{\lambda}\, \rho\, I_{\lambda}$$
	where, $\sigma_{\lambda} =$ scattering coefficient, sometimes included in $\kappa$
## emission
- the change in specific intensity with respect to the depth due to emission: 
$$\frac{dI_\lambda}{dz} = \epsilon_\lambda\,\rho$$
	where, $\epsilon_{\lambda}=$ emission coefficient
