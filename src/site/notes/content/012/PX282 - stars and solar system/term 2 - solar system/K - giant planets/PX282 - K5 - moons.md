## jupiter

- four large **galilean moons***, with many smaller, non-spherical moons, probably mostly captured asteroids
- density decreases with separation from jupiter, as the volatile content (ices) increases
- this is likely due to temperature gradients in the disc surrounding jupiter during the formation of the moons
- also, tidal heating evaporates volatiles (due to resonant orbits of the moons)
- **io** is rocky and volcanic, with a very young surface
- **europa** has a rocky core, and a young icy surface as it is resurfaced by liquid water from tidally heated subsurface ocean
- **ganymede** and **callisto** have masses dominated by ice, with older cratered surfaces, with some cracks due to geological activity (water ice, rather than rock)
## saturn
- seven spherical moons, with one very large moon, **titan**
- titan has a thick $1.5$ bar N$_2$ atmosphere with photochemical hydrocarbon haze
- radar imaging with huygens probe show liquid methane rivers and lakes
- **enceladus**, a relatively small moon, which orbits relatively close to satrun
- due to tidal heating, it has oceans of liquid water below a thin ice crust
## uranus
- at least 27 moons, with five approximately spherical ones with similar composition/density trends to the galilean moons
- they are aligned with the $98\degree$ spin obliquity of the planet, suggesting that the moon system formed from the debris disc from the giant collision that caused the tilt
## neptune
- at least fourteen moons, with one spherical, **triton**
- it is probably a dwarf planet, captured from the kuiper belt as it has a retrograde orbit
- it may have destabilized the primordial moon system of neptune

## rings
### saturn
- made up of ice particles of sizes: $\sim 0.01-1$ m
- they have a complex structure due to orbital resonances with saturn's moons
- it is extremely thin due to collisions when any particle orbits out of the disc plane, and have disc crossing orbits
- the main rings extend from $\sim 1.2 - 2.3 R_p$ 
- the roche limit:
$$a_{R} = 2.456 \left(\frac{\rho_{p}}{\rho_{m}}\right)^{1/3}\,R_{p}$$
- for saturn, ${} \rho_{p} = 700 {}$ kg m$^{-3}$, and assuming that $\rho_{m} \simeq 1000$ kg m$^{-3}$ (icy moon)
$$a_{R} = 2.2\,R_{p}$$
- this aligns with the outer extent of the rings
- so, this implies that the rings were probably a tidally disrupted icy moon that migrated in to its roche limit, maybe due to tidal synchronization
- there is also a dusty, 'E' ring, association with ejection from enceladus

### others
- jupiter, neptune and uranus, all have dusty rings similar to saturn's 'E' ring
