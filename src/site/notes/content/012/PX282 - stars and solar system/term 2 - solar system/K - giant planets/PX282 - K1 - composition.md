- from the radius and mass, it has been found that jupiter and saturn are dominated by gas, hence called **gas giants**

- similarly, uranus and neptune have less gas
- they have higher proportions of common ices of volatile elemets: H$_2$O, NH$_3$, CH$_4$ 
- hence, they are called **ice giants**
- they do have hydrogen and helium envelopes
