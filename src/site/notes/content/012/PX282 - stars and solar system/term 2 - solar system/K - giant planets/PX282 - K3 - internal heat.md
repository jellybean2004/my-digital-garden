- all giants have thermal emission temperatures (effective temperatures) higher than their equilibrium temperatures
- this implies additional sources of internal heat

- jupiter can be heated from the gravitational potential energy left over from formation as it is slow to cool due to its large size
- saturn and jupiter have ongoing differentiation from He rain, releasing gravitational potential energy, which is supported by an under-abundance of He in their atmospheres
- neptune probably also has ongoing differentiation of metals/rocks
- uranus does not have a significant excess heat, which is a mystery
