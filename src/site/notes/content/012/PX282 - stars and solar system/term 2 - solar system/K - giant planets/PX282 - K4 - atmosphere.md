- the composition is mainly the H and He envelope, enriched in CH$_4$, NH$_3$ (also H$_2$O)

- distinct bands of **bright zones***, with reflective clouds of ammonia ice, and **dark belts***, with red/brown colour from molecules formed by UV photosensitivity with deeper visibility
- in thermal infrared, the banding pattern is reversed as high altitude clouds are cold and dark
- the cloud-free belts are brighter because it probes deeper, into higher temperatures
- clouds in zones condense as warm material rises and cools in convection pattern
- the clouds evaporate in dark belts as they sink and the temperature rises
- rising and north-south spreading in convection bands carries angular momentum and results in strong local over/under rotation, ie. east-west winds
- many storms at the shearing boundaries, including the **great red spot**

- has a similar banding pattern to jupiter, but is muted because the clouds form deeper, in the colder atmosphere
- occasional storms bring reflective NH$_3$ clouds to higher altitudes

- almost featureless, blue due to methane abundance
- very faint banding
- later, strong white clouds were visible, possibly due to seasonal variations

- colder with deeper NH$_3$ ice clouds, with more muted banding
- the blue colour is from enhanced methane abundance, which strongly absorbs red optical light
- high altitude white clouds from methane ice condensing at these low temperatures
