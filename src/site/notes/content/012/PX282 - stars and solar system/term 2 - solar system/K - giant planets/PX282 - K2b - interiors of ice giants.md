- the masses of uranus and neptune are dominated by 'ices' in fluid form. eg: H$_{2}$O, NH$_{3}$, CH$_{4}$, CO$_{2}$, CO
- majority of the volume is H and He
- this is why they have intermediate densities, sitting between the terrestrials and the gas giants
- they are supported by large over-abundance of CH$_4$ in atmospheres

- they are rapid rotators, but lower mass allows **spin obliquity** to be perturbed as they do not have as much spin angular momenta
- uranus has an obliquity of $97.8\degree$, which is likely due to a giant collision

- their magnetic moments are $\sim \times 50$ and $\times 25$ of earth's, respectively
- this is despite a lack of metallic hydrogen
- this is because the ices become ionized at extreme pressures

- they have complex corkscrew magnetospheres due to high obliquities, and dipole misalignments with the spin axes
