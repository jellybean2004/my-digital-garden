- 8 planets in 3 classes
## classes
### terrestrial
- primarily iron and rock (silicates)
- deficient in **volatiles** 
### gas giants
- primarily H/He gas around a rocky/icy core 
- rotate rapidly with strong magnetic field 
- have a rich system of moons
### ice giants
- rocky/icy core surrounded by a thinner H/He envelope
- rotate rapidly with strong magnetic field 
- have a rich system of planets
### others
- dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets
- mainly found in the **asteroid** and **kuiper** belts, and the **oort cloud**

## formation
- all have approximately circular orbits in the same direction in **ecliptic plane**, aligned with the spin of the sun
- this shared angular momentum led to the **nebular hypothesis**, which is a natural consequence of conservation of angular momentum during gravitational collapse
- this proposes that the sun and the planets formed together from the gravitational collapse of gas with shared angular momentum

## definition of  a planet
- IAU, 2006 set out three criteria that a celestial body must satisfy to be classified as a planet

- it must be in **orbit around the sun**
- it must have **sufficient mass** for its self-gravity to **overcome rigid body forces** so that it assumes a **[[content/012/PX282 - stars and solar system/term 1 - stars/A - introduction/PX282 - A0 - hydrostatic equilibrium\|hydrostatic equilibrium]]**, basically, must be **spherical**
$$\frac{dP}{dr} = - \frac{GM_{r}\rho(r)}{r^{2}}$$
- it must have cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit

- if only the first two are satisfied, it is called a **dwarf planet**, eg: pluto, ceres
- **small solar system bodies** satisfy just the first criteron, eg: asteroids and comets

- there are issues with this definities:
	- the third criterion has border line cases, even for earth
	- does not include exoplanets
	- has no upper limit on the size or mass, so stellar companions can be included
