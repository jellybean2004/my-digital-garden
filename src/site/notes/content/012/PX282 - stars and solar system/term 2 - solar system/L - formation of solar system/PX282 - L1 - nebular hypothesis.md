- following the gravitational collapse of gas in a molecular cloud, and the conservation of angular momentum, a ***proto planetary disc*** is formed
- this is orbiting around the young sun, which explains why all the planets are orbiting in the same plane and are aligned with the spin of the sun

- the ***minimum mass of the solar nebula*** can be estimated by spreading out the planets and topping up to solar composition:
$$\Sigma (r) \propto r^{-3/2} $$
	where, $\Sigma$ is the surface density of the disc (\[kg m$^2$\])
- the total disc mass:
$$M_{disc} \geq 0.01\,M_{\odot}$$
- assuming that the gravitational potential energy is radiated locally in the disc:
$$T_{disc} \propto r^{-3/4}$$
- the amount of solid materials increases beyond he ***snowline*** (boundary between the terrestrials and the giants)
- the lifetimes of protoplanetary discs around young stars $\sim 10^7$ years
