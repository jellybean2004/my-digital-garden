- the **corona**, which is the extended atmosphere, is visible during an eclipse
- light scattering off free electrons in the extended atmosphere

- in optics, the **photosphere** is seen, where the sun transitions from **optically thick** (opaque) to **optically thin** (transparent)
- in extreme UV, $\gamma$ and x-rays, the extended emission from hot plasma is seen

- **temperature inversion** in the solar atmosphere of up to $-10^6\,K$
- the heating is related to the magnetic field, but the mechanism is poorly understood

- x-ray spectrum emission lines, dominated by excitation due to collisions
- show optically thin thermal emission from a hot plasma

- in the corona, the plasma is confined to many magnetic field loops by the [[content/011/PX157 - electricity and magnetism/PX157 - C - magnetic fields/PX157 - C1a - the lorentz force\|the lorentz force]]
