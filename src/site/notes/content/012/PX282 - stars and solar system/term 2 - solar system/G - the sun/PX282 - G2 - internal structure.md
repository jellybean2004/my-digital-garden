- the granulations on the solar surface are due to **convection** extending to about $30\%$ of the radius into its interior
- this is known from the properties of **helioseismology**, which is the study of standing sound waves at the surface (pressure/p-modes) with a periodicity of about $5\,min$
- this is sensitive to the temperature profile, $T(r)$, and the rotation composition (pressure profile, $P(r)$, and density profile, $\rho(r)$)
- this gives numerical models of the solar interior, and the boundary between the convective and the radiative regions

- the sun evolves to higher luminosity on the main sequence, which leads to **the faint young sun paradox**
