- the solar magnetic activity varies in an 11 year cycle
- approaching the maximum, the number of sunspots increases
- at the start of each cycle, sun spots are seen at high latitudes
- later, they emerge closer to the equator
- the x-ray emission also increases

- the magnetic field cycles between toroidal and poloidal due to differential rotation
- this causes the magnetic field to be reversed
- this is called the **solar dynamo model**

- at the beginning, few sunspots with magnetic field close to a dipole
- differential rotation drags the field lines from poloidal to toroidal
- twisted magnetic flux loops emerge, giving sunspots
- meridional flows drag them towards equator
- opposite polarity toroidal components cancel
- solar magnetic field reverts to dipole with opposite polarity

- the large-scale magnetic field (solid lines) is similar to a dipole (dashed lines)
- coronal plasma can escape along 'open field lines' as a **solar wind**
- this causes the **ion tail** of comets and can also erode planet atmospheres

- at earth, solar winds with  velocities $\sim 500\,km\,s^{-1}$, and number densities $\sim 7\times10^6\,m^{-3}$ can be seen
$$\frac{1}{2} m_{H}v_{H}^{2} \simeq \frac{3}{2} k_{B}T \implies T \approx \frac{m_{H}v_{H}^{2}}{3k_{B}} = 1.0\times10^{7}\,K$$
- this is comparable to the coronal temperatures, but an additional energy source is needed to explain this temperature
- it is believed that the winds are assisted by [**alfven waves**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfv%C3%A9n_wave) propagating along magnetic field lines excited by convection at the photosphere

## mass loss rate
- considering the mass of a thin shell in wind around the sun with a radius $r:$
$$\begin{gather*}
dm  = \rho \,dV = n_{H}m_{H}(4\pi r^{2}\,dr) \\
\implies \frac{dm}{dt}  = 4\pi r^{2} n_{H}m_{H} v  = 3\times10^{-14}\,M_{\odot}yr^{-1} 
\end{gather*}$$
- this is negligible compared to the solar mass (c.f. [[content/012/PX282 - stars and solar system/term 1 - stars/E - stellar evolution/PX282 - E5e - asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\|AGB stars]], the mass loss rate is $\sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$)
- this is still significant for the loss of angular momentum and spin is slowed down
- the wind is force to corotate with the sun, ie. the sun exerts a torque on the wind, transferring angular momentum and slowing down solar rotation
- the angular momentum:
$$J = mvr = m \frac{2\pi r}{P_{spin}} r  \implies \frac{J}{m}\propto r^{2}$$
- $J/m$ is called the **specific angular momentum**
- there is a significant ***magnetic braking***

*image: NASA*, lines represent magnetic field lines and arrows represent solar winds

- solar wind blows a bubble in ***interstellar medium (ISM)***, the ***heliosphere*** $\sim120$ AU
- ***magnetic reconnection*** in coronal flux loops can drive **solar flares**, and **coronal mass ejections (CMEs)**
	- **solar flares** are sudden released of energy as x-rays, $\gamma$-rays, radio and optical wavelength emissions
	- **CME** is the ejection of plasma from the solar corona
- these drive space weather in earth (like aurora)
- they also cause erosion of planet atmosphere and affect the habitability
