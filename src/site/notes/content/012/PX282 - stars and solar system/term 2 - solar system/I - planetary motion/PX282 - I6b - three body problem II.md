- considering that one mass dominates (eg. the sun), and the others are considered as ***perturbations*** (eg. planets)
- eg: the discovery of neptune via perturbations on uranus' orbit

- this leads to **secular resonances*** in the eccentricity, $e$, and inclination, $i$
- these cause **milankovich cycles*** for earth, which influences the climate

- when periods have integer ratios, perturbations grow in ***mean motion resonances***, often driving systems unstable
- eg: moons of jupiter, stabilized by the tidal interactions with jupiter
