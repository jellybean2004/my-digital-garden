- from [[content/012/PX282 - stars and solar system/term 2 - solar system/I - planetary motion/PX282 - I2 - kepler's laws\|kepler's second law]], it is known that the planet sweeps out an equal area in equal time intervals
- therefore, a planet has the largest velocity, and hence the highest kinetic energy when passing by the **perihelion** (closest to the star), and the lowest potential energy
- also, it will have the lowest kinetic energy when passing by the **aphelion** (furthest away from the star, and the highest potential energy

$$P^{2} = \left(2\pi \frac{a}{v}\right)^{2} = 4\pi^{2} \frac{a^{2}}{v^{2}} = 4\pi^{2} \frac{a^{3}}{GM_{\odot}}$$
$$\implies v^{2} = \frac{GM_{\odot}}{a}$$
$$T = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{GMm}{2a} = \frac{U}{2}$$
- therefore, the [[content/012/PX282 - stars and solar system/term 1 - stars/D - stellar structure and interiors/PX282 - D4 - virial theorem - energy in stars\|virial theorem]]:
$$2 \langle{T}\rangle - \langle{U}\rangle$$

- this applies to all gravitationally bound systems in equilibrium
