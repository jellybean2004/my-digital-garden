- **tidal interactions** arise due to differential gravity across an object:
$$\begin{gather}
 F = \frac{GMm}{r^{2}} \\
\frac{dF}{dr} = - \frac{2GMm}{r^{3}}
\end{gather}$$
- the object becomes slightly elongated, exhibiting ***tidal bulges***
- for earth $\simeq 10$ cm, and for moon $\simeq 20$ m

- bulges offset by rotations (ie earth spins faster, so its bulge leads the moon)
- then, the gravitational force acts to **synchronize rotation** with the orbit
- eg: earth's spin is slowing down ($\sim 1.6$ mins per century) and moon is spiraling out ($\sim 4$ cm per year) with transfer of angular momentum from rotation to orbit (moon is already synchronized)
- for a slowly spinning planet, the synchronization can spin up the planet and decay the orbit of the moon
- the tides depend very strongly on the orbital separation: $F_{tides} \propto \frac{1}{r^{3}r^{2}}\propto \frac{1}{r^{5}}$

- eccentric orbits still misalign tidal bulges after synchronization
- this leads to dissipation of energy and heating the planet/moon by internal friction - ***tidal heating***
- this causes the circularization of the orbit (orbit loses energy at a constant average mass)
- it can stabilize mean motion resonances, eg. moons of jupiter and tidal heating of io and europa

- tides can lead to the break up of an object when tidal forces $>$ self gravity (**roche limit**)
