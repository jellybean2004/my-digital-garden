## first law

>[!note] kepler's first law
>a planet orbits the sun in an **ellipse**, with the sun at a **focus** of the ellipse

- mathematically, an ellipse is described by:
$$r' + r = \text{constant} = 2a$$
	where,
		$r'$ and $r$ are the distances from the foci to a point on the perimeter,
		 $a$ is the **semimajor axis**, which is the widest radius 
		 also, $e$, the ellpticity/eccentricity

- considering a point, $Q$, on the perimeter:
$$r^{2} = b^{2} + a^{2}e^{2} \implies b^{2}= a^{2}(1-e^{2})$$
### conic sections

| eccentricity | shape     |
| ------------ | --------- |
| $e = 0$      | circle    |
| $0 < e < 1$  | ellipse   |
| $e = 1$      | parabola  |
| $e>1$        | hyperbola |
- all these shapes are allowed orbits
## second law

>[!note] kepler's second law
>a line connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals

## third law

>[!note] kepler's third law
>the orbital period $(P)$ squared is proportional to the semimajor axis $(a)$ cubed
> $$P^{2} = k\,a^{3}$$

- therefore, $P$ gives the relative distance from the sun
- eg: $P^{2} \text{[yr]} = a^{3} \text{[AU]}$

- by measuring the parallax of transit of venus, the value of an astronomical unit was determined to $1\%$ of the modern value (1769,1771)
- modern value is determined from radar measurements of venus
