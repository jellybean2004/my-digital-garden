- the atmosphere is transparent to the heating from the sun in optical light
- but it is more opaque to outgoing IR radiation 
- this is due to molecular absorption (especially from water and carbon dioxide)

- $L_{in}$ must equal total ${} L_{out}: {}$
$$T_{s}^{4} = 2T_{p}^{4}$$
- with $N$ optically thick layers:
$$T_{s}^{4} = (1+N)T_{p}^{4}$$
- considering continuous absorption:
$$T_{s}^{4} = \left(1 + \frac{3}{4}\tau\right)T_{p}^{4}$$
	where, $\tau$ is the optical depth

- comparing the two equations, $\tau \simeq 1.33$ is equivalent to one optically thick layer

- for earth, $\tau_{IR }\sim 0.8$, $T_{p} = 255$ K $\implies T_{s} \simeq 287$ K $\simeq 14\degree$C
- for venus, $T_{p} = 230$ K, $T_{s} = 735$ K $\implies \tau_{IR }\simeq 100$ 

- in practice, the wavelength dependence of absorption needs to be accounted for
