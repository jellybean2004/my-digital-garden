## earth

- earth is **differentiated** into layers
- it has an iron core, silicate mantle (rocks), and a crust of lighter minerals
- heavier materials sank when planet was molten
- the mantle is solid, but flows and convects on geological timescales

- seismic activities cause different waves:
	- **pressure/primary/p-waves** are compressional, that propagate in solids and liquids
	- **shear/secondary/s-waves** are transverse, that propagate only in solids
- these are probed with **seismology** 
- the **shadow zones** of these waves allow the interior to be mapped
- bulk of the earth is dominated by Fe, O, Si, Mg in ***refractory compounds*** (solids at high temperatures)
- it is strongly deficient in common **volatile*** elements, eg: H, C, N
- this implies that it was formed in warm environment where H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, NH$_3$ did not form solids
- the interior remains hot due to radioactivity, with heat flux $\sim 0.1$ Wm$^{-2}$
- a strong magnetic field, generated by a magnetic dynamo
- earth seems to be unique in exhibiting plate tectonics
- it has a fractured ***lithosphere*** (crust and upper mantle) that moves on convecting ***athenosphere***
- new crust is created at mid ocean ridges that reveals the history of the magnetic field of earth
- this shows polarity reversal in a $\sim 0.5$ Myr cycle
- this is strong evidence of a dynamo operating in earth
- vocalic island chains (eg. canary islands) above **mantle plumes** (upwelling convection cells)

- it is expected other terrestrial planets also differentiated, and heated by radioactivity
- looking at the cooling timescales:
$$\tau_{rad} = \frac{\text{surface area}}{\text{volume}} \propto \frac{R^{2}}{R^{3}} \propto \frac{1}{R}$$
- so, the interior of smaller objects tend to be cooler

## moon
- **lunar seismology** shows thicker lithosphere and small molten core
- there is no global magnetic field, so the dynamo is not active
- but there is evidence of global magnetic field in the past from rock samples
## mars
- recent detections of **marsquakes** show that mars also has a thick lithosphere, and a molten core
- there is no global magnetic field
- there is evidence of dynamo in the past
## venus
- no seismology, but volcanically active
- lacks plate tectonics and magnetic field, which is not well understood
## mercury
- high density implies an oversized iron core
- that together with tidal heated may explain its weak magnetic field
- it may have lost most of its mantle in a giant collision
- this left behind the relatively large core, similar to the formation of earth's moon
