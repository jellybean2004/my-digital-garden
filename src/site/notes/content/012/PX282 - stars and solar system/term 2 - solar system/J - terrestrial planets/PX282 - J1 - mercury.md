- heavy cratering, implying a geologically inactive ancient surface ($4.5$ Gyr)
- a high density and a weak magnetic field, implying the presence of a large iron core
- low albedo, similar to that of the moon, implying $T_{p} \simeq 436$ K, with a very poor heat redistribution
- slow rotation due to solar tides
- low obliquity, which is the tilt of the spin axis
- icy polar craters
