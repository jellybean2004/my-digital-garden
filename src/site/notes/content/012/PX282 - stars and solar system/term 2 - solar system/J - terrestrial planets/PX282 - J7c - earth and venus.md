>[!question] why are venus' and earth's atmospheres so different?

- CO$_2$ dissolves in water, forming carbonic acid
- this causes acid rain, which erodes silicate rocks
- the calcium carbonate is deposited as ocean sediments (limestones), which comprises of $99.6\%$ of earth's carbon
- this ***negative feedback*** in ***carbon-silicate cycle*** stabilizes the climate

- increase in CO$_2$ $\to$ increase in the surface temperature $\to$ increase in ocean evaporation $\to$ erosion $\to$ deposition of calcium carbonate $\to$ decrease in CO$_2$
- CO$_2$ is also returned to the atmosphere by volcanoes when ocean plates are subducted

- on venus, there is a competing **positive feedback loop**, which leads to **runaway greenhouse**
- increase in CO$_{2}\to$ increase in the surface temperature $\to$ increase in ocean evaporation $\to$ increase in water vapour $\to$ increase in surface temperature
- this happens until all the water is evaporated into the atmosphere: $T_{s} \simeq 1000$'s K
- this forms magma ocean, and the carbon-silicate cycle shuts off
- CO$_2$ from volcanoes accumulates in atmosphere

- earth is not heated enough for runaway greenhouse, even with 100 bar CO$_2$, unlike venus
- early earth probably had a thicker CO$_2$ atmosphere, avoiding freezing when the sun was fainter
- this could be the answer to the **faint-young sun paradox**

- the total quantity of CO$_2$ and N$_2$ is actually very similar for earth and venus, with CO$_2$ as ocean sediments on earth
- the water on venus is believed to be split by UV photosynthesis into H and O
- H evaporated into space
- supported by the large excess of deuterium on venus, which is less vulnerable to evaporate than H
