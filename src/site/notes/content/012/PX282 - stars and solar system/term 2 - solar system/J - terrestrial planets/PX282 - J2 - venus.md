- reflective sulfuric acid clouds, yielding a high albedo $(0.8)$
- its temperature, $T_{p} = 230$ K (lower than the earth, despite being closer to the sun)

- thick CO$_2$ dominated atmosphere, that causes strong greenhouse effect, and a high surface temperature $\sim 735$ K

- a slow rotation but good heat redistribution because of the thick atmosphere

- mapped with radar, thousands of volcanoes and only some impact craters are visible, implying a young surface
