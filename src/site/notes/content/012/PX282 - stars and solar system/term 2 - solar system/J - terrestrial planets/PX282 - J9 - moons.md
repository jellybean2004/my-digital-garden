- **mercury and venus**: no moons

- **earth**: a single large moon, believed to have been formed from a giant impact

- **mars**: two small captured asteroids - phobos and deimos

- phobos orbits faster than mars spins (0.3 days vs ~1 day)
- the tidal synchronization is spinning up mars and causing the orbit of phobos to decay
- phobos will eventually break apart when it fills its roche lobe/hill sphere

## roche limit

- it is the limit to orbital separation, where the self gravity is smaller than the differential gravity from the planet
$$dF_{G} = - \frac{2GMm}{r^{3}}\,dr$$
$$\frac{GM_{m}m}{R_{m}^{2}} \leq \frac{2GM_{p}m}{a^{3}}$$
	where, 
		$M_m$ is the mass of the moon, 
		$M_p$ is the mass of the planet, 
		$m$ is the mass of a test particle, 
		$R_{m}$ is the radius of the moon, 
		and $a$ is the orbital separation

- the roche limit:
$$a_{R}^{3} = 2 \frac{M_{p}}{M_{m}} R_{m}^{3}\implies a_{R} = 2^\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\rho_{p}}{\rho_{m}}\right)^{1/3} R_{p}$$
	where, $M = 4/3\;\pi R^{3}\rho$

- this is for a rigid body that maintains its shape
- for a fluid body (in hydrostatic equilibrium), the the pre-factor of $2$ changes to $2.456$

- slow rotation of mercury and venus means that any moon within their hill spheres would spiral in, and eventually be destroyed at its roche limit
- also, their proximity to the sun means very small hill spheres
