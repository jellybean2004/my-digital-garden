- planets show ***secular resonances***, which are oscillations in eccentricity and inclination
- mercury has the most eccentric and advance of ***perihelion***
- this led to the first test of general relativity
## rotation
- earth and mars rotate rapidly, whereas mercury and venus rotate very slowly due to tidal interactions (synchronization) with the sun
- tides are also slowing the rotation of earth, seen directly in sea shell fossil records

- the true rotation period is the **sidereal day*** , while the **solar day** for earth is slightly longer (4 min) due to orbital motion
$$\frac{1}{P_{solar}}= \frac{1}{P_{spin}} - \frac{1}{P_{orbit}}$$
- the difference is much more for slowly rotating planets
- for mercury, it is thrice longer than its spin period

- venus has a very slow retrograde rotation due to faster retrograde circulation of the atmosphere driven by solar heating

- mercury's rotation is stuck in $3:2$ resonance with its eccentric orbit (spins $1.5$ times per orbit), keeping its small permanent deformation aligned with the sun at perihelion (where tidal forces are the strongest)
## obliquity
- it is the angle at which the spin axis is tipped
- mercury and venus have very small obliquities due to tidal synchronizations
- earth and mars have an obliquity $\sim 23\degree$
- this is the reason for seasons
