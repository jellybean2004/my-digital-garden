## moon
- heavily cratered, implying an ancient surface
- less cratered regions, **mare*** (lit. seas) are giant impact basins filled with lava flows until $3$ Gyr ago
- this was measured with **radioisotope dating*** of rock samples
- this allows the calibration of cratering history across the solar system
- impacts also trace the thickness of lunar lithosphere
- impacts also trace thickness of lunar lithosphere with time
- lava flows are traced by **rilles***
- the lunar surface is covered with soil called **regolith***, which is a fine powder from many impacts
- rock samples returned by apollo and other missions, also lunar martian meteorites, can be dated with radioisotope dating
- the abundance of a isotope A, eg: uranium-235, is:
$$A(t) = A_{0} \exp(-\lambda t)$$
	where, $\lambda = \ln(2)/\tau_{1/2}$ is the decay constant

- decay to a daughter product, eg: lead-207:
$$A(t) + B(t) = A_{0} + B_{0} = A(t) \exp(\lambda t) + B_{0}$$
$$\implies B(t) = (\exp(\lambda t) - 1) A(t) + B_{0}$$

- in special cases, $B_{0} = 0$ can be assumed, eg: lead in zircon crystals, so $t$ is the only unknown
- otherwise, it can be calibrated using a different isotope of the same element, B', for which abundance is constant in time

$$\implies \frac{B(t)}{B'} = (\exp(\lambda t) - 1) \frac{A(t)}{B'} + \frac{B_{0}}{B'}$$
- B' is still unknown, but it can be assumed that that ratio is constant for different crystals within a single rock sample because of similar chemical properties of B and B'
- the exponential term becomes the gradient of a graph of $B/B'$ vs $A/B'$ measured for multiple crystals in a single rock sample

## other planets
- mercury cratering: implies ancient surface $> 4$ Gyr
- mars cratering: resurfacing until $\sim 2$ Gyr ago

- venus: 
	- only large craters(> 3 km) as smaller bodies form up in the atmosphere
	- cratering rate of the entire planet resurfaced $\sim 1$ Gyr ago
	- there are thousands of volcanoes, but no sign of plate tectonics
