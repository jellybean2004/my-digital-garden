## Background
Phase transition refers to the physical change in state a medium undergoes owing to a variation in its external conditions such as temperature or pressure. Paul Ehrenfest classified phase transitions into first and second order. In first order transitions, the free energy, which is the energy available to perform work at a constant temperature, has a discontinuity in the first derivative with respect to thermodynamic variables such as pressure or temperature. This can be observed as latent heat during melting or evaporation of water. In second order, the second derivative is discontinuous, resulting in a smooth transition. Typically, phase transitions involve breaking of symmetries, wherein the high-temperature phase contains more symmetries

The Big Bang theory suggests that the universe, in its nascent stage, was hot and dense. All the particles and the four forces we know now existed in one form. As it expanded and cooled, the whole universe underwent a series of changes in states, which is termed cosmological phase transition. One such transition is the Electroweak phase transition.
