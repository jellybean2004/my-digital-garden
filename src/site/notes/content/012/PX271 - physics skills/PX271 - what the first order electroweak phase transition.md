## phase transition
- it refers to the physical process in which a medium undergoes a change from one state to another
- it arises from a change in external conditions such as temperature and pressure
- eg: water $\leftrightarrow$ ice, superconductivity in metals and ceramics below a critical temperature, breaking of symmetries in the early universe
### ehrenfest classification
- based on the behaviour of thermodynamic free energy, $E$, as a function of other thermodynamic variables (eg: $T,p$)
	- $E$ is the portion of energy available to perform work at a constant temperature
- the classes are:
	- **first-order phase transition** have a discontinuity in the first derivative
		- eg: melting of ice, where the density, $\rho = \left(\frac{dE}{dp}\right)^{-1}$, exhibits a discontinuous change
		- they involve a *latent heat*
	- **second-order phase transition** have a discontinuity in the second derivative
		- eg: ferromagnetic phase transition, where the magnetization (first derivative) increases continuously wrt applied B-field strength, but the magnetic susceptibility changes discontinuously

### symmetry
- phase transitions often involve breaking symmetry/ies
- typically, the high-temperature phase contains more symmetries
## cosmological phase transition
- a physical process wherein all the matter in the universe undergo a change in state as a whole
- it is theorised that the early universe, which was hot and dense, underwent a series of phase transitions
- relics of such transitions could be observed
- one such phase transitions involves the electroweak force splitting into the electromagnetic and the weak nuclear forces, a process termed *electroweak phase transition*
- the transition occurred when particles started gaining mass from the higgs field
- bubbles of energy were formed in the higgs field as a result of the symmetry breaking
- these bubbles grew and collided, eventually filling the whole universe
- the energy release could have created 'out-of-equilibrium conditions' needed for baryogenesis, which could explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry
