- consider the change in the internal energy of a system, ie: the first law of thermodynamics:

- *note:* d bar used for inexact differentials
- the total expression is an exact differential, but it is the sum of inexact partial differentials
- "thermodynamic potentials" can used, where the variables involved are fully specified: 
	$$dU = T\,dS - p\,dV$$
	where, $T$ is temperature, ${} S$ is entropy, $p$ is pressure, and $V$ is volume
