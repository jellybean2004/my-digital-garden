- consider the change in the internal energy of a system, ie: [[content/011/PX154 - physics foundations/PX154 - D - the first law of thermodynamic/D - the first law of thermodynamics\|D - the first law of thermodynamics]]:

- *note:* d bar used for inexact differentials
- the total expression is an exact differential, but it is the sum of inexact partial differentials
- "thermodynamic potentials" can used, where the variables involved are fully specified: 
	$$dU = T\,dS - p\,dV$$
	where, $T$ is temperature, ${} S$ is entropy, $p$ is pressure, and $V$ is volume
