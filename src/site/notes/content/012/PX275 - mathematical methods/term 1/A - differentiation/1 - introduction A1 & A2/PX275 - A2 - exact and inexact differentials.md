## exact differential
$$df = x\,dy + y\,dx$$
- comparing with the total differential: 
$$\begin{align*}
	\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right) &= y \\
	\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) &= x \\
	f(x,y) &= xy+c
\end{align*}$$
- this is an **exact differential**
## inexact differential
$$df = x\,dy -y\,dx$$
- there is no function, $f(x,y)$, for which the above is true
- this is an **inexact differential**
