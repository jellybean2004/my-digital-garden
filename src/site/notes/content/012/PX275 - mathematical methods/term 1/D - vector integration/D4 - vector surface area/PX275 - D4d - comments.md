- for a closed curve (eg: the circular loop in the $x$-$y$ plane), the total vector surface area of any surface spanning curve is a property of the curve itself
- the shape of the surface is irrelevant
- a closed curve and an open surface have been considered

- the total vector surface area: 
$$\vec S_{2,top} = -\vec S_{2,bottom} \implies \vec S_{2} = 0$$
