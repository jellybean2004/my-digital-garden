- consider a current-carrying wire, with the current, $I$, in the $+z$ direction
- at a point, $P$, at a distance, $\rho$, away from the wire, the magnetic field strength is: $B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi\rho}$
- in cartesian system: 
$$\vec B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi\rho} (-\sin\phi\hat i +\cos\phi\hat j)$$
- in cylindrical polar: 
$$\vec B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi\rho} \hat e_\phi$$
