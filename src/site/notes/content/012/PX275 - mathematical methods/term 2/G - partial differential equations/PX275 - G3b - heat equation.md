- a similar mechanism is heat transport, where the diffusion PDE is applicable
- considering the density of heat, $Q(x,t):$
$$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} \propto \frac{\partial^{2} {Q}}{\partial {x}^{2}}$$
- since there is a local heat flux $\propto \cfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x}$ (fick's law again)

- a simple example: a uniform, isolated bar of length, $L$, with a constant heat capacity, $c$
- the local temperature:
$$T \propto c\,Q$$
- therefore, the heat equation:
$$\frac{\partial T(x,t)}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^{2} {T}}{\partial {x}^{2}}$$
	where, $\kappa$ is the thermal diffusivity
