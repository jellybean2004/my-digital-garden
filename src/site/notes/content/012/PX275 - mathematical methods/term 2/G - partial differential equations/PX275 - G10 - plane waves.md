- the solution for the 3D wave equation:
$$u(\vec r, t) = C \exp(i(\vec k \cdot \vec r+ \omega t))$$
	where, $\omega^{2}= c^{2}|k|^{2}$

- considering two points on a plane perpendicular to $\vec k$, $\vec r_{1}$ and $\vec r_{2}$
- so, $\vec k \cdot (\vec r_{2} - \vec r_{2}) = 0$

- the vector equation for a plane is: $$\vec k \cdot \vec r = d$$
- for a plane wave, $(\vec k \cdot + \omega t)$ is constant across a plane
- the planes represent a nominal phase of a wave

- surfaces of constant phase are parallel planes
- 'right' moving waves have $\vec k$ in the positive direction, and 'left' moving in the negative

- therefore, a wavevector gives:
	- the direction of the plane wave
	- its wavelength: $\lambda = 2\pi/|\vec k|$
