- to find the first dark fringe for an airy pattern
- zero crossing of an airy pattern occurs at $x = 1.22\pi/2$
$$\implies \frac{k\rho R}{D} = \frac{1.22\pi}{2}$$
- for small angles, $\sin \theta  \approx \theta \approx \rho/D$
$$\implies kR\theta = \frac{1.22\pi}{2}$$
- the angular separation:
$$\theta = \frac{1.22\pi}{2kR} = \frac{1.22\lambda}{4R}$$
- this is the **rayliegh criterion for diffraction limited resolution**
- the sources cannot be resolved if the central maxima overlap
- the minimum angular separation that can be resolved is:
$$\Delta \theta  > \frac{1.22\lambda}{2R}$$
	where, the units are in radians

- eg: eye, $R = 3$ mm, $\lambda = 500$ nm $\implies \Delta\theta \simeq 20^{''}$ (arcseconds)
- eg: a telescope, $R = 0.5$ mm
	- visible: $\lambda = 500$ nm $\implies \Delta\theta \simeq 0.125^{''}$
	- UV: ${} \lambda = 200 {}$ nm $\implies \Delta\theta \simeq 0.05^{''}$
	- infrared: $\lambda = 10\,\mu$m $\implies \Delta\theta \simeq 2.5^{''}$
