- considering a plane wave approaching an obstructor with an aperture
- after passing through the aperture, the wave is curved, which is due to **diffraction**

- now, considering the obstructor has two apertures
- the diffracted waves interact at multiple points, which is called **interference**

- if the source is coherent, the interference can occur due to differing path lengths
- if the path lengths differ by $n \lambda$, where $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, this gives **constructive interference** as the waves meet in phase
- if the path lengths differ by $n\lambda/2$, this gives **destructive interference** as the waves meet out of phase
