- this is the interference due to differing path lengths from multiple coherent sources
- coherent light sources have the same time dependence: $e^{-i\omega t} = e^{-ikct}$
- incoherent light sources offer random phases, so there cannot be interference, and the intensities simply add up

- a wavefront is a constant phase surface, only well defined for coherent sources
- a point source is a secondary source in huygen's principle
- a point source is not the same as a plane wave
- the intensity is given by: $I(r) = |u|^{2}$
$$\oint I(r)\,dr  = \text{constant}$$
- by the conservation of energy:
$$4\pi r^{2} I(r) = \text{ constant}$$
- this is the luminosity
$$\implies |u| \propto \frac{1}{r}$$
- splitting $u(\vec r, t)$ into two parts:
$$u(\vec r, t) = \frac{v(\vec r, t)}{r}$$
	where, $r = |\vec r|$
