- light diffracts
- can be understood using huygen's principle

>[!note] huygen's principle
>- every point  on wavefront acts as a source of symmetric wavelets
>- sum of wavelets forms the next wavefront

- when $x = \lambda$, destructive interference, ie. $\theta = \lambda/D$
- angles of light rays defined to within $\sim \lambda/D$
- therefore, cannot resolve rays less than $O(\lambda/D)$ apart

- for circular aperture, require $\Delta \theta > 1.22\lambda/D$ to resolve light rays, which is called the **rayliegh criterion**

- wavefronts correspond to converging spherical wavefronts
- uncertainty in the image of light rays $\sim 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}\times f$
