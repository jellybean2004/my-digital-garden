- bound charges can also flow and cause currents

- the magnetic dipole moment:
$$\vec m = I \vec A$$
- units: A m$^{2}$
- magnetization magnetic dipole moment per unit volume:
$$\vec M = \frac{\sum\limits_{i\in V} \vec m_{i} }{V}$$
- considering a bar magnet
- the equivalent net current will be a current around the outside of the material

- uniform magnetization can be modelled as a uniform grid of current loops in x-y plane
- considering a block of volume $\Delta x \, \Delta y \, \Delta z:$
$$m_{z} = I \Delta x \, \Delta y$$
- the current density:
$$j_{z} = \frac{I}{\Delta z}$$
	which is the current in the x-y plane

- the magnetization:
$$M_{z} = \frac{m_{z}}{\Delta x \, \Delta y \, \Delta z} = \frac{I}{\Delta z} = j_{z}$$

- generalize to all directions:
$$\vec j_{M} = \vec M \times \hat n$$
