- light comes from infinity, ie. light rays are parallel
- passes through the '**objective lens**' (big)
- focusses onto focal plane at distance $f_1$ from the objective lens
- second lens, '**eyepiece**', is at a distance $f_2$ from the focal plane
- light rays emerge parallel to be looked at  by observer

- using small angle approximation:
$$d \approx \theta f_{1} \approx \alpha f_{2}$$
- the magnification:
$$\frac{\alpha}{\theta} \approx \frac{f_{1}}{f_{2}}$$
- light through the objective lens should also pass through the eyepiece

- to match $D_{obj}$ and $D_{eye}$, require:
  $$D_{obj} = \frac{f_{1}}{f_{2}}D_{eye} = M\,D_{eye}$$
- $D_{eye}$ should match the geometry of the human eye
- diameter of the pupil $\sim5\,$mm

- using binoculars/telescopes, more light enters the eye
- this allows to see faint objects
- increased by $\left(\cfrac{D_{obj}}{D_{eye}}\right)^{2} = M^{2}$

- but spread out over a large area increased by $\left( \cfrac{\alpha}{\theta} \right)^{2} = M^{2}$
- therefore, intensity of light at retina (power power unit area per unit solid angle) is unchanged
