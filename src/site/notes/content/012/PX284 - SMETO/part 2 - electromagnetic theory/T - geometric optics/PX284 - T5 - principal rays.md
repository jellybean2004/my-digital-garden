- useful to classify lenses and make diagrams
- considering three cases for converging and diverging lenses

- parallel rays (from infinity)
	- **converging:** converge at focus
	- **diverging**: diverge, seems to come from a point source at focus

- intersecting at the centre of the lens
	- **converging** & **diverging**: no change

- exit as parallel rays
	- **converging:** coming from a point source at focus
	- **diverging**: coming from a source that would converge at the focus
