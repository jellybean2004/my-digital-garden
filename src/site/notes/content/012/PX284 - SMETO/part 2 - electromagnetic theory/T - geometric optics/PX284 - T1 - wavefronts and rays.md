- when the wavelength is much smaller than typical object lengths, light can be represented by rays
- eg: visible light ($\lambda \simeq 500\,$nm) interacting with lenses ($\sim\,$cm)

- for light incident from infinity, the wavefronts are parallel
- from a finite distance, it can be spherical, eg: a point source
- it can also converge
