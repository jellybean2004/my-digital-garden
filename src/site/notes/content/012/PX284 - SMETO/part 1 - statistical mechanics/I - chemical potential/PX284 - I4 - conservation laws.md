- particle conservation laws put constraints on the value of $\mu$

- eg: considering a box of particles that can be freely absorbed and emitted at fixed $V$ and $T$
- minimizing $F$ with respect to $N:$
$$\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial N}\right)_{V,T } = \mu = 0$$
- therefore the boltzmann distribution can be used

- eg: photons, phonons
