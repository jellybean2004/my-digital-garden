- considering two systems that can exchange particles, with temperatures and numbers of particles: left $(T_{1}, N_{1})$ and right $(T_{2}, N_{2})$
- if $N = N_{1}+ N_{2}$ is fixed:
$$\frac{dN_{2}}{dN_{1}}= -1$$
- the entropy will change on exchange of particles, and from the [[content/012/PX284 - SMETO/part 1 - statistical mechanics/C - entropy and temperature/PX284 - C1d - second law\|second law of thermodynamics]] it must increase:
$$dS = \left( \frac{\partial S_{1}}{\partial N_{1}}\right)_{E,V} dN_{1} + \left(\frac{\partial S_{2}}{\partial N_{2}}\right)_{E,V} dN_{2}  \geq 0$$
- previously:
$$\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial N}\right)_{U,V} = - \frac{\mu}{T}$$
$$\therefore dS = \left(\frac{\mu_{1}}{T_{1}}- \frac{\mu_{2}}{T_{2}}\right)dN_{2} \geq 0$$

- thus, if $T_{1} = T_{2}$ and $\mu_{1}>\mu_{2}: dN_{2} >0$ and particles flow from left to right
- flow will continue until equilibrium: $\mu_{1} = \mu_{2}$
- ie. entropy causes particle flow
