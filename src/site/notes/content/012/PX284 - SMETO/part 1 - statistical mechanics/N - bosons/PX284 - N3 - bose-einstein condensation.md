$$N = \int_{0}^{\infty} (2s+1) \frac{V}{(2\pi)^{2}} \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar}\right)^{3/2}\frac{E^{1/2}}{\exp(\beta(E-\mu))-1}\,dE$$
- the above equation has no solutions for $T<T_{C}$, where for $s = 0:$
$$k_{B}T_{C} = \frac{2\pi\hbar^{2}}{m} \left(\frac{n}{2.612}\right)^{2/3}$$
- this is because at low temperatures, all the bosons want to be in the ground state
- it can be shown that the fraction of particles in the ground state:
$$\frac{n_{0}}{n} = 1 - \left(\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right)^{3/2}$$
- below $T_C$, a macroscopic number of particles occupy the same quantum state
- this new state is called a **bose-einstein condensate** (BEC)
- by analogy with liquid/gas phase change, but BEC doesn't require interparticle interactions
- BEC observed in ultracold atoms
