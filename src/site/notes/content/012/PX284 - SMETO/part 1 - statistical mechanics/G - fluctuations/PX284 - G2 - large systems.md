- for $N$ independent and distinct particles:
$$Z_{N} = (Z_{1})^{N} $$
- for a system of $N$ particles:
$$\langle{E}\rangle = - N \frac{d\ln{Z}}{d\beta}$$
- $\langle{E}\rangle$ is **extensive**

- **extensive:** scales with the size of the system. eg: $\langle{E}\rangle=U$, hence $C_{V}$
- **intensive:** local properties. eg: temperature

- so, $\sigma_{E} \propto \sqrt{C_{V}} \propto \sqrt{N}$
- and, the relative size of fluctuation: 
$$\frac{\sigma_{E}}{\langle{E}\rangle} \propto \frac{\sqrt{N}}{N} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$$
- so, if $N\to\infty$, $\cfrac{\sigma_{e}}{\langle{E}\rangle} \to 0$

- **conclusions:** 
	- fluctuations are important in small systems, but are negligible for macroscopic systems
	- in general, deviations from any quantity about the average (eg. pressure, magnetization) become insignificant in the large $N$ limit
- **note:** fluctuations are important near critical points

- eg: for the phases of  water
	- near the critical point, $C_V$ can diverge
	- fluctuations become significant
	- fluctuations in density can be observed - **critical opalescence**
