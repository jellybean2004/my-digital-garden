- statistical mechanics is concerned with understanding and predicting the properties of a '*system*'
- eg: a box of gas, ions in a solid, electrons in a star
- there exists a '**reservoir**' with which systems can exchange energy or particles
- typical systems:
	- $1\,l$ of N$_{2} {}$ gas $\sim 10^{22}$ molecules
	- $1\,g$ of NaCl $\sim 10^{22}$ molecules
	- $1\,cm^{3}$ of Cu $\sim 10^{22}$ electrons
	- the sun $\sim 10^{57}$ electrons
- **isolated systems:** not connected to a reservoir, therefore the energy $(E)$, the number of particles $(N)$, and the volume $(V)$ are fixed

### model system
- the [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/term 1/B - introduction/PX262 - B6 - 1D harmonic oscillator\|simple harmonic oscillator]]
- **potential energy:** 
$$V = \frac{1}{2} m\omega^{2}x^{2}$$
- **solution:** 
$$E_{n} = \left(n+ \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \omega$$

- $\boxed{2}$ indicates a system in state, $n=2$
- there can be $N>1$ simple harmonic oscillators
- consider $N=4:$ 
$$\begin{matrix}\boxed{1} & \boxed{2} & \boxed{0} & \boxed{3}\end{matrix}$$
- the energy of the system: 
$$E = (1+2+0+3)\hbar\omega + \frac{4\hbar\omega}{2}$$
- the last term is fixed at $\frac{N\hbar\omega}{2}$, which is called the **zero-point energy (ZPE)**, the energy of the ground state
- **ZPE** is an important result of quantum mechanics that may sometimes be ignored for convenience
