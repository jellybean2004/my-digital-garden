- considering a two particle system with wavefunctions:
$$\psi(\vec r_{1} , \vec r_{2})$$
- defining the exchange operator as:
$$\hat P_{12} \psi(\vec r_{1}, \vec r_{2)} = \psi(\vec r_{2} , \vec r_{1})$$
- but if the particles are identical, swapping them should make no **measurable** difference, ie: $|\psi(\vec r_{1} , \vec r_{2})|^{2} = |\psi(\vec r_{2} , \vec r_{1})|^{2}$
$$\hat P_{12} \psi(\vec r_{1} , \vec r_{2}) = \psi(\vec r_{2} , \vec r_{1}) = \pm \psi(\vec r_{1} , \vec r_{2})$$

- there are two types of exchange symmetry

## type 1
- $\psi$ symmetric under particle exchange: $\psi(\vec r_{1} , \vec r_{2}) = \psi(\vec r_{2} , \vec r_{1})$
- particles with this symmetry have integer values of quantum numbers and are called **bosons**
## type 2
- $\psi$ antisymmetric under particle exchange: $\psi(\vec r_{1} , \vec r_{2}) = -\psi(\vec r_{2} , \vec r_{1})$
- particle with this symmetry have half-integer quantum numbers, and are called **fermions**
