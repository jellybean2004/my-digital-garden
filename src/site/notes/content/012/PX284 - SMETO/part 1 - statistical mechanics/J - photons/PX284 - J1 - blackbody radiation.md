- an ideal absorber and emitter of radiation that absorbs all incident radiation and has an **emissivity** of $1$, ie. emits **isotopically**
- for a blackbody in an enclosed space, the energy density of emitted light:
$$U = \int_{0}^{\infty}U_{\lambda} \, d\lambda = \int_{0}^{\infty}U_{U} \, dU = \int_{0}^{\infty}U_{\omega} \, d\omega$$
	where, $U_{U}$ is the spectral energy density, and $U_{\lambda}\,d\lambda$ is the energy density due to radiation between $\lambda$ and $\lambda + d\lambda$

- planck's guess formula:
$$U_{\lambda} = \frac{8\pi hc}{\lambda^{5}} \cfrac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{hc}{\lambda k_{B}T}\right)- 1}$$
