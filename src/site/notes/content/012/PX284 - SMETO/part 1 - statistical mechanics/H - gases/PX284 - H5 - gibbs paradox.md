- distinguishability is key to resolving a paradox posed by gibbs
## situation 1
![PX284 - H5 - gibbs paradox.png|500](/img/user/pics/PX284%20-%20H5%20-%20gibbs%20paradox.png)

 - considering the isothermal expansion of a particle:
$$\Delta S = N k_{B}\ln 2$$
	where, $2$ comes from the volume doubling

## situation 2!
![PX284 - H5 - gibbs paradox-1.png|500](/img/user/pics/PX284%20-%20H5%20-%20gibbs%20paradox-1.png)

- in this case:
$$\Delta S = 2 N k_{B} \ln 2$$

## situation 3
![PX284 - H5 - gibbs paradox-2.png|500](/img/user/pics/PX284%20-%20H5%20-%20gibbs%20paradox-2.png)

- now, considering the case where both parts of the box have the same particles
- before and after appear no different, ie. it is reversible, and from the [[content/012/PX284 - SMETO/part 1 - statistical mechanics/C - entropy and temperature/PX284 - C1d - second law\|second law]] of thermodynamics:
$$\Delta S = 0$$

>[!question] why is situation 3 different from situation 2?
>because indistinguishability is a fundamental property, not an experimental inadequacy, and this was shown formally by sackur and tetrode
