- the solar irradiance curve at the top of the atmosphere can be modelled by a blackbody distribution ($T = 5800$K)

- the structure in the irradiance curve at the sea level is due to absorption by gases like CO$_2$, H$_2$O, O${} _3$, O$_2$, etc

- eg: to understand the overall reduction in intensity, at the surface of the sun: $I_{\lambda}(max) = 8.5\times10^{7}$ W m$-2$ $\mu$m$^{-1}$
$$I_{\lambda}(max) = \frac{E_\lambda}{4\pi R_{\odot}^{2}}$$
at the surface of the earth:
$$I_{\lambda} = I_{\lambda}(max) = \frac{4\pi R_{\odot}^{2}}{4\pi R_{SE}^{2}}$$
	where, $R_{SE}$ is the sun-earth distance

- therefore, $I_{\lambda}= 0.19\times10^{4}$ W m$-2$ $\mu$m$^{-1}$

- most transitions in atoms and molecules occur at energies of less than $1$ eV, and solar photons can trigger these
- ionising potentials (energy required to eject an electron from the least bound state) are larger or much larger than $5$ eV
- ionising radiation causes cell damage

- transitions in atoms/molecules $<$ solar photons $<$ ionisation energy
	- the first inequality governs the interaction between light and matter
	- the second saves the skin
