- a collection of copies of the system representing all different possible microstates
## the microcanonical ensemble
- it describes an **isolated** system with **fixed energy**
## the canonical ensemble
- it describes a system which can **exchange energy with a large reservoir** 
- it **fixes the temperature** of the system
## the grand canonical ensemble
- it describes a system which can **exchange energy and particles with a very large reservoir** 
- it **fixes the temperature** of the system, as well as **the chemical potential** $(\mu)$
