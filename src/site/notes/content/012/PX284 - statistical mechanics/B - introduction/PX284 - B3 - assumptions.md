### assumption 1
- each of the possible microstates of an isolated system in thermal equilibrium is equally likely to occur
### assumption 2
- the system's dynamics are such that the microstate is constantly changing
### assumption 3
- given enough time, the system will explore all possible microstates, and spend equal time in each
- this is known as the **ergodic hypothesis**
### consequences
- a system will appear to choose the macrostate associated with the maximum number of microstates
- the measured value of an observable is equal to the average over all accessible microstates
### example
- three SHOs with $E = 2\hbar \omega$ (ignore ZPE)
- the expected value of $E^{(1)}:$ 
$$\langle{E^{(1)}}\rangle = \sum\limits_{i}E_{i}^{(1)}p_{i} = \frac{1}{\Omega} \sum\limits_{i}E_{i}^{(1)}  = \frac{1}{6}(2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0)\hbar \omega = \frac{2}{3} \hbar \omega$$
	where, $p_{i}$ is the probability of that microstate occurring, and $\Omega$ is the number of microstates
