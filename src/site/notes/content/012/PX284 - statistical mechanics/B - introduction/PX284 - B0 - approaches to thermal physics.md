## thermodynamics
- assumes a unique normal state called '*thermal equilibrium*'
- states four laws relating pressure, temperature, internal energy, entropy, and volume
- the laws are empirical and justified experimentally
## statistical mechanics
- defines '*thermal equilibrium*' and entropy in terms of microscopic probabilities
- gives the probability of a particular state
- determines measurable properties using averaged over states
