- the entropy is given by the **gibb's entropy formula**: 
$$\boxed{S = -k_{B} \sum\limits_{i}P_{i} \ln P_{i}}$$
	where, $i$ is the number of accessible states, and $P_{i}$ is the probability of being in state $i$
- for an isolated system in equilibrium, there will be $\Omega$ equally likely accessible states, therefore the entropy is: 
$$\therefore S = -k_{B}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\Omega} \frac{1}{\Omega} \ln\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right) = k_{B} \ln\Omega$$
