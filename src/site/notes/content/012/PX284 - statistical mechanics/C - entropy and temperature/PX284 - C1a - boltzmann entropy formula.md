- the entropy associated with a macrostate of an isolated system in an equilibrium is given by the **boltzmann entropy formula**: 
$$\boxed{S = k_{B} \ln\Omega}$$
	where, $\Omega$ is the number of equally likely microstates associated with this macrostate
- consequently, the more **microstates accessible, the less defined is the system**, and the greater the entropy
- thus **entropy is related to disorder**
