- **in thermodynamics**, [[content/012/PX284 - statistical mechanics/C - entropy and temperature/PX284 - C1 - entropy\|entropy]] cannot be measured directly, but the changes in entropy can be measured using the heat capacity
- for a reversible process at constant volume, using the [[content/011/PX154 - physics foundations/PX154 - D - the first law of thermodynamic/D - the first law of thermodynamics\|first law of theromodynamics]]: 
$$\begin{gather*}
	dU = T\,dS = C_{V}\,dT \\\implies \Delta S = \int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} \frac{C_{V}}{T}\,dT
\end{gather*}$$
