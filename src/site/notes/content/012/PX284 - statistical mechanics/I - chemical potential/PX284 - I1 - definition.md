- the chemical potential, $\mu$, is defined as  the change in energy on adding a particle to the system
- from the [[content/011/PX154 - physics foundations/PX154 - D - the first law of thermodynamic/PX154 - D2 - the first law\|first law of thermodynamics]]
$$dU = T\,dS - p\,dV - \mu\,dN$$
$$\mu = (\frac{\partial U}{\partial N})_S,V$$
- also:
$$\mu = \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial N}\right)_{V,T} = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial N}\right)_{p,T}$$

- **note:** $G(p, T, N)$ is extensive, ie: scales with the system size
- therefore, not only is $\mu = (\cfrac{\partial G}{\partial N})_{p,T}$, moreover, it is the gibbs free energy per particle:
  $$\mu = \frac{G}{N }$$
