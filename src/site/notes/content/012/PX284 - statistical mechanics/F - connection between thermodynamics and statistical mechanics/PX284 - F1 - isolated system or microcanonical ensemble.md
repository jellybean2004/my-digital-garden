- in statistical mechanics:
$$\begin{gather*}
	S = - k_{B} \sum\limits_{i} P_{i}\ln P_{i} \\ 
	U = \sum\limits_{i} E_{i}P_{i} 
\end{gather*}$$
## thermodynamics
- [[content/011/PX154 - physics foundations/PX154 - E - the second law of thermodynamics/PX154 - E3 - the second law of thermodynamics\|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that, for all processes in an isolated system:
$$dS \geq 0$$
	where, the equality is for **reversible changes**
- a process is **reversible** if it:
	- is performed **quasi-statically** (slow chances via equilibrium states)
	- involves no dissipation (eg.: turbulence, electrical resistance)

- for a general process, $S$ increases until $dS = 0$ at equilibrium, ie. $S$ is maximized
## statistical mechanics
- in statistical mechanics: $S$ for an isolated two-state system:
$$S = -k_{B} \sum\limits_{i} P_{i}\ln P_{i} = - k_{B} [P_{1} \ln P_{1} + P_{2}\ln P_{2}]$$
