## postulate 2
- every dynamical variable is represented by a hermitian operator
- the measured values correspond to the eigenvalues of the given operator
- immediately after the measurement, the wavefunction will be the eigenfunction corresponding to the given eigenvalue
## postulate 3
- the position and the momentum operators are $\vec r$ and $-i\hbar\vec v$ 
- the other operators bear the same functional form as in classical physics
