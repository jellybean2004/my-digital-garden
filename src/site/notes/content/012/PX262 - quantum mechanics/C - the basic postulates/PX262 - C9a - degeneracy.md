- it was assumed that all eigenvalues are different, which is not always true
- in a degenerate system there can be multiple states with distinct eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue of a given dynamical variable
- there are two places where the arguments go wrong:
	- orthogonality
	- compatibility of measurements
