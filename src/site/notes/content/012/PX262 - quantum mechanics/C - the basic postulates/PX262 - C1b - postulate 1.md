## postulate 1
- for every dynamical system, there is a wavefunction that is a continuous, square-integrable, single-valued function of the parameters of the system and of time
- from this wavefunction, all possible predictions about the physical properties of the system can be obtained
- the parameters: 
	- in the examples: coordinates, time
	- could be other things needed to describe the system

- **notation:** 
	- $\psi$ will be used a for the general solution of the time-dependent schrödinger equation
	- $\phi$ will be used a for the general solution of the time-independent schrödinger equation
	- $\phi$ will be used to denote the '*eigenfunctions*'
	- $\mu$ will be used to denote the general solution of TISE, which does not have to be an eigenfunction
