- taking approximation by discrete steps, but also the limit $\Delta\to0$, the eigenvalue equation becomes: 
  $$\hat Q \phi (k,x) = q(k) \phi (k,x)$$
	where, $k$ is a continuous variable that labels individual steps (like the subscript $n$)
- the orthonormality of he eigenfunctions becomes:
$$\int \phi^{*}(k,x) \phi(k',x) \,dx = \delta(k-k')$$
- the general wavefunction can be written as a liner superposition of eigenfunctions as: 
  $$\psi(x) = \int a(k)\phi(k,x)\,dk$$
