## postulate 1
- for every dynamical system, there is a wavefunction that is a continuous, square-integrable, single-valued function of the parameters of the system and of time
- from this wavefunction, all possible predictions about the physical properties of the system can be obtained
## postulate 2
- every dynamical variable is represented by a hermitian operator
- the measured values correspond to the eigenvalues of the given operator
- immediately after the measurement, the wavefunction will be the eigenfunction corresponding to the given eigenvalue
## postulate 3
- the position and the momentum operators are: $\hat R = \vec r$ and $\hat P = -i\hbar\vec v$ 
- the other operators bear the same functional form as in classical physics
## postulate 4
- when a measurement of a dynamical variable represented by an operator, $\hat Q$, is carried out on a system with a wavefunction, $\psi = \sum_{n}a_{n}\phi_n$,  were $\phi_n$ is an eigenfunction of the operator, then the probability to obtain the result $q_m$ will be $|a_{m|^2}$
$$a_{n} = \int \phi_{n}^{*} \psi \,d\tau$$
## postulate 5 
- between measurements, the development of the wavefunction is governed by the time-dependent schr√∂dinger equation
