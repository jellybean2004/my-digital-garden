- if two or more sides of the potential well are of the same length, eg: $a=b$, the energies of the states will be: 
  $$E_{n_{1}n_{2}n_{3}} = \frac{\hbar^{2}\pi^{2}}{8M} \left( \frac{n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{n_{3}^{2}}{c^{2}} \right)$$
- in such cases, there will be several states with the same energy, ie. it is a **degenerate system**
- eg: $(n_{1}=1, n_{2}=2)$ and $(n_{1}=2, n_{2}=1)$ have the same energies but different corresponding eigenfunctions
- 3D systems exhibit such behaviour regularly
