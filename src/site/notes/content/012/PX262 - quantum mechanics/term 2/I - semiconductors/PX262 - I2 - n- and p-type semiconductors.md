- these include semiconductors, such as Si and Ge, doped with a very low concentration of impurities (1 part in $10^5$) such as P, As or B, Ga, which have either one more or one less valence electron per atom

| element | valence      |
| ------- | ------------ |
| P       | $3s^2\,3p^3$ |
| As      | $4s^2\,4p^3$ |
| B       | $2s^2\,2p^1$ |
| Ga      | $4s^2\,4p^1$ |

- the impurities can either donate an electron into the conduction band (P, As), or remove one (making a **'hole'**) from the valence band (B, Gn)
- the substitution ad a Si atom by an impurity (eg P) can be modelled by adding a fixed positive charge, $+e$, $(Z_{P}= Z_{Si}+1)$ at a site along with an additional electron
- such a centre of positive charge can bind one of the additional electrons
- the donor impurities can introduce additional electronic states close to the bottom of the conduction bands

- electrons are easily thermally excited into the conduction bands from those levels at room temperature and the majority of the carriers are electrons creating an n-type semiconductor
- a similar model can be applied for the acceptor impurities, eg: B, Ga
- the model is now a superposition of a fixed $-e$ $(Z_a = Z_{Si}-1)$ on top of the host atom with the absence of 1e electron in the crystal
- the affect of the 'missing' electrons is represented by additional unfilled energy levels, 'holes', at $E_a$, just above the valence bands

- $E_a-E_v$ is the energy needed to excite an electron from the top of the valence bands into an acceptor energy level filling a 'hole' near one of the acceptor impurities
- it makes a free 'hole' / positively charged in the valence band
