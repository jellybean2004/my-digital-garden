- it occurs at the boundary of one region doped with p-type impurities and another with n-type impurities

- the current flow is given by: 
$$I = i_{s} \left(\exp\left(\frac{eV}{k_{B}T}\right) - 1 \right)$$
	where, $i_s$ is the saturation current

- this acts as a one way device

- when two regions are in equilibrium, they must have the same chemical potential

- in equilibrium, no net current flows through the junction but carriers cross back and forth
- when first connected, the many holes in the p-region diffuse across the junction, into the n-region, where they can recombine with some of the many free electrons
- similarly, for electrons diffusing from the n-region to the -region
- this sets up an electric field, $\vec \varepsilon_{elec}$, and the potential energy associated with this field raises the energy levels in the p-region relative to those in the n-region so that the chemical potentials align
- upward shift (AB) $\simeq \Delta$

- in equilibrium, there are four currents across the junction
- the diffusion processes lead to a recombination of holes and electrons, $i_{pr}$ and $i_{nr}$
- at the same time, the electron-hole pairs are generated by thermal excitation, $i_{pg}$ and $i_{ng}$
- the electric field, $\vec \varepsilon_{elec}$ sweeps them out of the junction
- at equilibrium, these currents balance:
$$\begin{gather}
i_{pr}+ i_{pg} = 0 \\
i_{nr}+ i_{pr} = 0
\end{gather}$$
- note: 
	- $i_{ng} \propto \exp(-\Delta/k_{B}T)$, the probability of exciting a minority carrier in the p-region, an electron
	- $i_{nr} \propto \exp(-\Delta_{AB}/k_{B}T)$ the probability of a majority carrier flowing from the n-type region, ie. the probability that a majority carrier has enough energy to surmount the barrier, $\Delta_{AB}$
