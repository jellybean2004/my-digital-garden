- in many solid materials, the nuclei are arranged into ordered structures, ie. **crystal lattices**
- they possess translational symmetry
- this affects the electronic states
- a perfect crystal can be generated by decorating each point in the lattice with the same basis (atoms as groups of atoms)
- a lattice is an infinite array of mathematical points in space with translational symmetry

- in 3D, the lattice consists of all points with position vectors, $\vec R$, in the form: $\vec R = n_{1}\vec a + n_{2}\vec b + n_{3}\vec c$, where, $\vec a$, $\vec b$, $\vec c$ are three non-coplanar vectors
- the so-called 'primitive vectors' of the lattice and $n_{1}$, $n_2$ and $n_3$ over all positive and negative integers

- the unit cell of a lattice in 3D is a parallelepiped with volume: $V_{c} = | \vec a \cdot (\vec b \times \vec c)|$
- packing the unit cells together fills all space

- there are just fourteen 3D crystal structures with different symmetries - **the bravais lattices**
- they are in seven groups: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, hexagonal, trigonal, monoclinic, and triclinic

## wigner-seitz cell
{ #c1c48b}


- this is a cell which is constructed around a lattice point
- it is the space enclosed by the planes that bisect, and are perpendicular to the vectors connecting the point to each of the nearest neighbours
