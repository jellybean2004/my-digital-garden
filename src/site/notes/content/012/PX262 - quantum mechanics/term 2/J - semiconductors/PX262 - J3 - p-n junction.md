- it occurs at the boundary of one region doped with p-type impurities and another with n-type impurities
- the current flow is given by: 
$$I = i_{s} \left(\exp\left(\frac{eV}{k_{B}T}\right) - 1 \right)$$
	where, $i_s$ is the saturation current
- this acts as a one way device

- when two regions are in equilibrium, they must have the same chemical potential

- applying this to p-type semiconductor in contact with an n-type:

- in equilibrium, there is no net current through the junction, but carriers cross back and forth
- when first connected, the many holes in the p-region diffuse across the junction, into the n-region, where they can recombine with some of the many free electrons
- similarly, electrons diffuse from the n to the p-region
- this sets up an electric field, $\vec \varepsilon_{elec}$
- the potential energy associated with this field raises the energy levels in the p-region relative to those in the n-region so that the chemical potentials align
- the upward shift (AB) $\simeq \Delta$

- in equilibrium, there are four currents across the junction
- the diffusion processes lead to a **recombination** of holes and electrons: $i_{pr}$ and $i_{nr}$
- at the same time, electron-hole pairs are generated by thermal excitation: $i_{pg}$ and $i_{ng}$
- the electric field, $\vec \varepsilon_{elec}$ sweeps them out of the junction
- at equilibrium, these currents balance:
$$\begin{gather}
i_{pr}+ i_{pg} = 0 \\
i_{nr}+ i_{pr} = 0
\end{gather}$$
- note: 
	- $i_{ng} \propto \exp(-\Delta/k_{B}T)$, ie. the probability of exciting a minority carrier in the p-region ($e^{-}$)
	- $i_{nr} \propto \exp(-\Delta_{AB}/k_{B}T)$, ie. the probability of a majority carrier flowing from the n-region (hole), or, the probability that a majority carrier has enough energy to surmount the barrier, $\Delta_{AB}$, where $\Delta \simeq \Delta_{AB}$

- applying a forward bias (positive potential difference) across the junction
- the electric field, $\vec\varepsilon_{elec}$, and the difference between the energy levels in the p-region and the n-region are reduced by: $\Delta E = - e V_{applied}$
$$\implies \Delta_{AB} = \Delta - e \, V_{applied}$$
- it becomes easier for the electrons in the n-type region to climb the potential barrier and diffuse into the p-region, and for the holes in the p-region to diffuse into the n-region
- both recombination currents $i_{nr}$ and $i_{pr}$ are increased by: $\exp(eV_{applied}/k_{B}T)$
- the generation currents, $i_{ng}$ and $i_{pg}$, do not change
- the net hole current:
$$i_{p,tot} = i_{pr} + i_{pg} = |i_{pg}| \left(\exp\left(\frac{eV_{applied}}{k_{B}T}\right)-1\right)$$
- similarly, the net electron current:
$$i_{n,tot} = i_{nr} + i_{ng} = |i_{ng}| \left(\exp\left( \frac{eV_{applied}}{k_{B}T}\right) - 1 \right)$$
- therefore, the total current:
$$I = i_{s} \left(\exp\left( \frac{eV_{applied}}{k_{B}T }\right) -1 \right)$$
	where, $i_{s} = |i_{pg}| + |i_{ng}|$

- therefore, this diode effectively allows current in the forward direction only
