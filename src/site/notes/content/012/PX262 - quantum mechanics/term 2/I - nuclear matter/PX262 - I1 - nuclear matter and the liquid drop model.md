- in realistic models of metals and other materials, the properties are determined by the electrons interacting with each other an the nuclei, where the nuclei are assumed to be stable (or slowly moving) point charges
- the relevant length scale $\sim 10^{-10}$ m
- the nuclei are comprised of many protons and neutrons $(10^{2} - 10^{3})$ interacting over length scales of $10^{-15}$ m
- nuclei contain most of the mass of the atoms, but much smaller
- ie: $m_{e} \simeq 9\times10^{31}$ kg ; $m_{p}, m_{n} \simeq 1.7\times10^{-27}$ kg

- **some facts for models to consider:** 
	- unstable nuclei decay, transforming spontaneously to other nuclei
	- when nuclei collide with enough force, there is fission and fusion (+ energy)
- scattering experiments show that a nucleus can be modelled roughly as a sphere with radius, $R$, which depends on the number of nucleons:
$$R = R_{0}A^{1/3}$$
	where, $R_{0} \simeq 1.2\times10^{-15}$, and $A = Z + N$ is the mass number $\propto$ volume of the nucleus

- masses of nuclei are measured in units of the **'unified atomic mass unit'**, u $= 1.6605\dots\times10^{-27}\,\text{kg}$
- $m_{p} \simeq m_{n} \simeq 1$ u, so the mass of a nucleus $\simeq A$ u
- the relation $R\propto A^{1/3}$ means that all nuclei have approximately the same density:
$$\rho  = \frac{Au}{4\pi/3\,R^3} = \frac{3}{4\pi} \frac{1.6605\dots10^{-27}A}{R_{0}A} \simeq 2.3\times10^{17} \text{kg m}^{-3}$$
- cf. density of iron $\sim 7000\text{kg m}^{-3}$

- neutrons and protons, like electrons, are fermions, and have spin-$1/2\,\hbar$
- they adhere to the **pauli exclusion principle**, and have magnetic moments that interact with magnetic fields

- nuclear binding energy is the energy required to separate nucleus into its protons and neutrons, $E_B:$
$$E_{B} = (Z m_{p}+ Nm_{n})c^{2} - (_{Z}^{A}Mc^{2})$$
	where, $_{Z}^{A}M$ is the mass of a nucleus of an element $M$, and is les than $(Zm_{p} + Nm_{n})$
- nearly all stable nuclei have binding energies in the range $7-9$ MeV per nucleon
