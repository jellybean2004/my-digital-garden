- photons and neutrons are bound together in nuclei, despite electrostatic interactions between protons, owing to the strong interaction
- **some characteristics:**
	- independent of charge
	- short-ranged $(10^{-5}\,\text{m})$
	- nuclear matter has a nearly constant density and for stable nuclei, a roughly constant binding energy per nucleon
- this suggests that each nucleon interacts with other nucleons in its immediate vicinity only
- the interactions are saturated (analogy with bonding in molecules)
- the nuclear force favours binding of pairs of protons or neutrons, eg: $_{2}^{4}$He
