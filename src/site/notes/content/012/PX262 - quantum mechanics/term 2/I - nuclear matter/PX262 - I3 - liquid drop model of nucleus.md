- based on observation that all nuclei have the same density
- individual nucleons appear to be analogous to molecules in a liquid
- it treats the nucleus as a droplet of incompressible nuclear material
- eg: a fission process
$$_{92}^{235}\text{U} + \text{slow neutrons} \to + _{40}^{97}\text{Zr} + _{52}^{137}\text{Te}$$
- a semi-empirical formula for the binding energy, $E_{B}$, has five terms in terms of $Z$, $N$ (and $A=Z+N$)
	- since the nuclear interactions show saturation, there is a term $\propto A$, $C_{1}A$, where $C_{1}$ is extracted from experimental data
	- nucleons on the surface of the nucleus are less tightly bound than those in the interior, negative terms $\propto 4\pi R^{2}$, $-C_{2}A^{2/3}$, ($R \propto A^{1/3}$)
	- each proton repels the other protons, electrostatic interaction $\propto 1/R$ term, $- C_{3} Z(Z-1)/A^{1/3}$
	- from experiments, nuclei appear to need a balance between energies associated with neutrons and protons so that $N \simeq Z$ from small nuclei, and $N$ is slightly larger than $Z$ for larger nuclear term: $- C_{4} (N-Z)^{2}/A = - C_{4}(A-2Z)^{2}/A$
	- nuclear forces favour pairing for both protons and neutrons. positive if both $Z$ and $N$ are even, $+C_{5}/A^{4/3}$, $-C_{5}/A^{4/3}$ if both are odd, or zero otherwise

$$E_{B} = C_{1}A - C_{2} A^{2/3} - C_{3} \frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}} - C_{4} \frac{(A-2Z)^{2}}{A} +(-) C_{5} A^{-4/3}$$

- all atomic masses are less than the sum of their parts owing to the forces keeping the nucleons together in terms of energy:
$$M_\text{atomic nucleus}c^{2} < Z m_{p}c^{2}+ N m_{n}c^{2}$$
- the binding energy:
$$E_{B }= (Zm_{p} + N m_{n})c^{2} - _{Z}^{A}Mc^{2} >0$$

>[!question] is there is a theoretical limit to the number of protons in a nucleus of an atom (and periodic table extent)?

- estimating from the bohr model
- electron orbiting a nucleus:
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{m_{e}v^{2}}{r} &= \frac{Ze^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r^{2}} \\
(m_{e}vr)v &= \frac{Ze^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}
\end{align*}$$
- in the above equation, $m_{e}vr$ is the angular momentum, $l = n\hbar$
$$v = \frac{Ze^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\hbar} < c$$
- the speed of the electron has to be less than the speed of light
$$Z_{max}= \left(\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\hbar c}\right)^{-1} = \frac{1}{\alpha}$$
	where, $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $\alpha = 1/137$
- so, $Z < 137$
- the heaviest element identified so far in experiment has $Z =118$, oganesson, $_{188}^{294}$Og
