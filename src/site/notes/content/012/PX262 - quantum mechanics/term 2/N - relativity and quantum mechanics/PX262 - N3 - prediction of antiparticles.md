- the dirac equation describes spin-$\hbar/2$ fermions like electrons, protons, neutrons, etc.
$$\begin{gather}
E^{2}  = p^{2}c^{2} + m^{2}c^{4} \\
E = \pm \sqrt{p^{2}c^{2} + m^{2}c^{4}} = \pm mc^{2} \left( 1 + \frac{p^{2}}{m^{2}c^{2}}\right)^{1/2}
\end{gather}$$
- ie. there are also negative energy solutions alongside the positive, which cannot be discarded
- instead, there is the **dirac sea** interpretation, which led to the prediction of antiparticles
- dirac proposed that the negative energy states are all occupied
- the pauli exclusion principle prevents the positive energy particles from falling into these filled states - **'filled sea'**
- if a photon with energy, $E = \hbar \omega > 2mc^{2}$, can excite an electron from a negative energy state, leaving behind a 'hole' in vacuum
- the holes correspond to the positive energy antiparticles with opposite charge to the particle states
- similarly, there is the prediction of particle-antiparticle annihilation to produce photons 
- positrons were discovered shortly after the prediction in 1933
