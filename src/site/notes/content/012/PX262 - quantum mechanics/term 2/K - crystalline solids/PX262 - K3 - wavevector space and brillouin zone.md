- the [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/term 2/K - crystalline solids/PX262 - K1 - electrons in crystalline solids#wigner-seitz cell\|wigner-seitz unit cell]] for the reciprocal space is called the **brillouin zone (BZ)**
- it is constructed in the same way as in the actual lattice

- picking a value of the wavevector, $\vec k$, anywhere in the space occupied by the reciprocal lattice points, appropriate to the electron waves, $A\exp(i\vec k \cdot \vec r)$
- in 1D, the reciprocal lattice:

- values in the first BZ are:
$$- \frac{\pi}{a} \le k \leq \frac{\pi}{a}$$
