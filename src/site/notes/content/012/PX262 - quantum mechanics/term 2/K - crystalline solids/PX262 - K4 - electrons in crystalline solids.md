- crystalline solids include metals, insulators and semiconductors
- in a crystal, the potential which describes an electron's interaction with the nuclei, and all the other electrons must also have the symmetry of the lattice
- recalling the free electron model as a simple model of a metal - it readily conducts

- for a more realistic crystalline potential, energy gaps open up
- if $E_F$ lies in a gap, the system is an insulator
