- **density functional theory** (DFT) takes the complex many electron problem of the material and the external influence from the (static) nuclei, and focuses all the effort into dealing with the electron charge density ($\rho_e$), ie. the probability of finding an electron at position, $\vec r_1$ (multiplied by $e$)
- the ground state energy of the system can be shown to depend on the charge density at every point: $E_{gs}[\rho(\vec r)]$
- DFT shows that $\rho(\vec r)$ can be found by solving the schr√∂dinger equation for a single electron moving in a potential set up by the nuclei and all the other electrons
- DFT is a widely used method to study the properties of materials
