- if light can behave as a particle, can particles also behave as waves?
- debroglie proposed that particles can behave as waves, and are assigned a frequency and a wave number: 
$$\begin{gather}
	E=\hbar \omega , \text{ where} (\omega=\text{ frequency})\\
	\vec p = \hbar\vec k , \text{ where} (\vec k = \text{ wavenumber vector})
\end{gather}$$
- in a *double slit experiment*, electrons are shot though a double slit and on a screen behind, typical wave interference pattern can be observed
