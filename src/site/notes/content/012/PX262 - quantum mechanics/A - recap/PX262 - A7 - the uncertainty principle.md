- wave-particle duality limits precision on how well we can measure the momentum and the position of a particle
- when measuring the position of a particle with a microscope, by illuminating particles with light of wavelength, $\lambda$, and a microscope with an aperture, $\alpha:$
	- in optics, the uncertainty in the position: 
	  $$\Delta x = \frac{\lambda}{\sin\alpha} \tag{1}$$
	- as photons behave as particles, they can affect the momentum: 
	  $$\Delta p \simeq p\sin\alpha = \frac{2\pi\hbar\sin\alpha}{\lambda}\tag{2}$$
- combining $(1)$ and $(2):$ 
  $$\Delta x \Delta p = 2\pi\hbar$$
- there is a fundamental limit in quantum mechanics when trying to measure the position and the momentum of a particle simultaneously, called the *heisenberg's uncertainty principle*: 
  $$\Delta x\Delta p \geq \frac{1}{2}\hbar$$
