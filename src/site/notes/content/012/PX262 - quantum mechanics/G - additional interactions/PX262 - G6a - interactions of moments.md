- from  [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/G - additional interactions/PX262 - G1 - particle with angular momentum in magnetic field\|here]], an electron with an orbital momentum, $\vec l$ has a magnetic moment:
$$\mu_{l} = - \frac{e}{2m_{e}}\vec l$$
- the magnetic moment associated with the spin is found to be almost exactly twice using relativistic quantum theory/experiments:
$$\mu_{s} = - \frac{e}{m_{e}}\vec s$$
- these moments separately interact with an applied magnetic field, [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/G - additional interactions/PX262 - G6c - zeeman effect\|the zeeman effect]]
- they also interact with each other, [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/G - additional interactions/PX262 - G6b - spin-orbit coupling\|spin-orbit coupling]]

- combining the hamiltonians of these two interactions, the interaction energy is given by the hamiltonian:
$$\begin{gather*}
\hat H '  = \underbrace{f(r) (\hat J^{2} - \hat L^{2} - \hat S^{2})}_\text{LS coupling} +\underbrace{\frac{e}{2m}B_{0} (\hat L_{z} + 2 \hat S_{z})}_\text{zeeman effect} \\\\
\text{where, } f(r) = \frac{\mu_{0}Ze^{2}}{4\pi m^{2}r^{3}}
\end{gather*}$$
