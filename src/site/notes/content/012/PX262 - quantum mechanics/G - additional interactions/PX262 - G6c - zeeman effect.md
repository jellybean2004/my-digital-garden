- considering the interaction of the moments with the external magnetic field
- for an external magnetic field with magnitude $B_0$ aligned along the $z$-axis, the hamiltonian operator is given by: 
$$\hat H_{B} = \frac{e}{2m} B_{0}(\hat L_{z}+ 2\hat S_{z}) = \frac{\mu_{B}}{\hbar} B_{0} (\hat L_{z}+ 2\hat S_{z})$$
