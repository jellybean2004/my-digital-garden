- for two electrons, the hamiltonian has a form:
$$\hat H = - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla_{1}^{2} - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla_{2}^{2} - \frac{2e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{1}} - \frac{2e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{2}} + \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{12}}$$
	where, 
		$\nabla_{1}$ and $\nabla_{2}$ represent the derivatives with respect to the coordinates of the two electrons;
		$r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the distances of the electrons from the nucleus, $r_{12}$ is the distance between the two electrons
- with more electrons, the hamiltonian will be similar with kinetic terms and potential from nucleus-electron and electron-electron each electron

- now, using this hamiltonian to solve the schr√∂dinger equation
- an approximation can be made where the interaction between electrons is ignored
- the equation splits into two, one for each electron, same as in the [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/F - 3D systems/PX262 - F6 - hydrogenic atom\|hydrogenic atom]]
- the electrons cannot be distinguished, and are placed in a common set of states in the lowest energy

- any particle with half-integer spin has to obey the **pauli exclusion principle**, which states that the wavefunctions of two identical particles have to be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of particles
$$u(r_{1}, r_{2}) = -u(r_{2},r_{1})$$
- consequently, only one particle can be in a particular state

- for just two electrons, they can both be placed in $1s$ state $(n=1,\,l-0,\,m_{l}=0)$ as each can have a different z-component of spin

- for more electrons, eg: $^{3}$Li, with $3$ electrons, two can be in the ground state: $1s^{2}$ (two electrons with $s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \hbar$), and another will be in $2s^{1}$
