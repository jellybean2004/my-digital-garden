- considering the classical motion of an electron on a circular path with a radius, $r$, and angular velocity, $\omega$
- the magnitude of the angular momentum will be: 
$$l = m\omega r^{2}$$
- it direction will be perpendicular to the plane of the orbit
- the circular movement will induce a current, $- \cfrac{e\omega}{2\pi}$, when moving around a loop of area, $\pi r^{2}$
- the magnetic moment will be equal to the product of the current and the loop area, its direction anti-parallel to $\vec l$ due to the negative sign: 
  $$\vec\mu = - \frac{e}{2m} \vec l$$
- using [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/C - the basic postulates/PX262 - C2c - postulates 2 & 3\|postulate 3]], the magnetic moment operator: 
  $$\hat{\vec\mu} = - \frac{e}{2m} \hat{\vec L}$$
- the $z$-component of the operator: 
  $$\hat{\mu}_z = - \frac{e}{2m} \hat{L}_{z}$$
- if a magnetic field, $\vec B$, is applied to this system, the energy of the interaction will be:
$$\Delta E = -\vec\mu \cdot \vec B$$
- in quantum mechanics, if the $B$-field is aligned with the $z$-axis: 
  $$\hat H = \frac{eB}{2m} \hat L_{z}$$
- systems that are eigenstates of $\hat L_z$, with eigenvalue $m\hbar$, a measurement will yield: 
  $$\Delta E = \mu_{B}Bm$$
- defining the **bohr magneton**
$$\mu_{B} = \cfrac{e\hbar}{2m}$$
- if the state with $l=1$ is put into the magnetic field, three transmission energies are expected in the spectra, for $m=-1,0,1$
