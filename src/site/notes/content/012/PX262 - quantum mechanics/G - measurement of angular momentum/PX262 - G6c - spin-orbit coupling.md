- setting the external magnetic field to zero
- there is no preferred axis and the energy eigenfunctions do not have to be eigenfunctions of $\hat L_z$ and $\hat S_z$
- they will still be eigenfunctions of $\hat J^{2}$, ${} \hat L^{2} {}$ and $\hat S^{2}$ operators
- good quantum numbers are then $n$, $l$ and $j$ as quantum numbers
- energy correction:
$$\delta E = \langle{f(r)}\rangle \, [j(j+1) - l(l+1) - s(s+1)] \, \hbar^{2}$$
- the three quantities are connected:
$$\begin{gather*}
	j = l+s &	\text{or, } j = |l-s| & \text{for } s = \frac{1}{2} \\
	j = l + \frac{1}{2} & \text{or, } j = l - \frac{1}{2} & \text{unless } l=0
\end{gather*}$$
- the energy levels will split #fig
