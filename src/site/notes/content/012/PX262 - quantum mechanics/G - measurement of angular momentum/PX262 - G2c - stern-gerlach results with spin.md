- adding angular momenta:
$$l_{1} \oplus l_{2} = l_{1}+l_{2}, l_{1}+l_{2}-2 , \dots,  |l_{1}-l_{2}|$$
- in the [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/G - measurement of angular momentum/PX262 - G2a - stern-gerlach experiment\|stern-gerlach experiment]], the orbital angular momentum and spin should be added
- for $l=1$, $s=0:$
$$l \oplus s = [l+s, |l-s|] = \frac{3}{2},\frac{\;1}{2}$$
- there will be 4 values for that $z$-projection: $+3/2, +1/2, -1/2, -3/2$
- thus, it can be concluded that an electron as spin $1/2$

- spin can take integer or half integer values: $n, n/2$
