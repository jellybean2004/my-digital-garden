- the effect of angular momentum needs to be observed to check the validity of quantum mechanics
- considering the classical motion of an electron on a circular path with a radius, $r$, and angular velocity, $\omega$, the angular momentum will be $l = m\omega r^{2}$ perpendicular to the orbit
- the movement will induce a current, $- \frac{e\omega}{2\pi}$, when moving around a loop with an area, $\pi r^{2}$
- the magnetic moment is: 
  $$\vec\mu = - \frac{e}{2m} \vec l$$
	where, $\vec L$ is the angular momentum
- introducing the magnetic moment operator: 
  $$\hat{\vec\mu} = - \frac{e}{2m} \hat{\vec L}$$
- the $z$-component of the operator is: 
  $$\hat{\mu}_z = - \frac{e}{2m} \hat{L}_{z}$$
- if a system with a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, they will interact
- a non-zero angular momentum will lead to a change in energy as $E = -\vec\mu \cdot \vec B$, which in quantum mechanics will be: 
  $$\Delta\hat H = \frac{eB}{2m} \hat L_{z}$$
	if the $B$-field is aligned with the $z$-axis
- states have $\hat L_z$ eigenvalues, $m\hbar$, and the interaction energy will be: 
  $$\Delta E = \mu_{B}Bm$$
	where, $\mu_{B} = \frac{e\hbar}{2m}$ is called the **bohr magneton**

if the state with $l=1$ is put into the magnetic field, there should be three energies for $m=-1,0,1$
