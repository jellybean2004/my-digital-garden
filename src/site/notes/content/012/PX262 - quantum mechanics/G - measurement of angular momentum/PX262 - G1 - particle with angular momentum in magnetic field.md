- the effect of angular momentum needs to be observed to check the validity of quantum mechanics
- considering the classical motion of an electron on a circular path with a radius, $r$, and angular velocity, $\omega$, so the angular momentum will be: $l = m\omega r^{2}$ pinting in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the orbit
- the circular movement will induce a current, $- \cfrac{e\omega}{2\pi}$, when moving around a loop of area, $\pi r^{2}$
- the magnetic moment is equal to the product of the current and the loop area: $\cfrac{e\omega}{2\pi}$, with its direction anti-parallel to $\vec l$ due to the negative sign
- hence, the magnetic moment is: 
  $$\vec\mu = - \frac{e}{2m} \vec l$$
	where, $\vec l$ is the angular momentum
- using [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/C - the basic postulates/PX262 - C2c - postulates 2 & 3\|postulate 3]]: 
  $$\hat{\vec\mu} = - \frac{e}{2m} \hat{\vec L}$$
- the $z$-component of the operator is: 
  $$\hat{\mu}_z = - \frac{e}{2m} \hat{L}_{z}$$
- if a system with a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, they will interact
- if a magnetic field, $\vec B$ is applied to such  a system, the energy of the interaction will be: $E = -\vec\mu \cdot \vec B$, which in quantum mechanics will be: 
  $$\hat H = \frac{eB}{2m} \hat L_{z}$$
	if the $B$-field is aligned with the $z$-axis
- systems that are eigenstates of $\hat L_z$, with eigenvalue $m\hbar$, a measurement will yield: 
  $$\Delta E = \mu_{B}Bm$$
	where, $\mu_{B} = \cfrac{e\hbar}{2m}$ is called the **bohr magneton**

if the state with $l=1$ is put into the magnetic field, there should be three energies for $m=-1,0,1$
