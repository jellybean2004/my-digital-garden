- starting with a large external magnetic field such that LS-coupling can be neglected
- expressing the expectation value for correction using quantum numbers:
$$\Delta E = \frac{e\hbar B}{2m} (m_{l}+ 2m_{s})$$
	where, $l$ and $s$ subscripts distinguish the two angular momenta
- if an electron in a state with a fixed $l$ is taken, the energy levels will split to $(2l+1)(2s+1)$ levels
	- here, $s = 1/2$
- they will all be equally spaced, but some might accidentally be degenerate
