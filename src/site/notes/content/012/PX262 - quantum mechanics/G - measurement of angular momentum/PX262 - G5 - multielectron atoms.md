- for two electrons:
$$\hat H = - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla_{1}^{2} - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla_{2}^{2} - \frac{2e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{1}} - \frac{2e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{2}} + \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{12}}$$
	where, 
		$\nabla_{1}$ and $\nabla_{2}$ represent the derivatives with respect to the coordinates of the two electrons, 
		$r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the distances of the electrons from the nucleus, $r_{12}$ is the distance between the two electrons
- interaction/potential between electrons complicates the solution
- contribution from two electrons and each will have solution like in [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/F - 3D systems/PX262 - F6 - hydrogenic atom\|hydrogen-like atoms]], ie. the same structure of state/energy levels
- electrons (any particles with half-integer spin) have to obey the **pauli exclusion principle**, which states that the wavefunction of two identical particles have to be antisymmetric
$$\mu(r_{1}, r_{2}) = -\mu(r_{2},r_{1})$$
- consequently, only one electron or particle can e in a particular state
- in an atom, the electron state is given by four quantum numbers: $u,l,m,spin$
- eg: $^{3}$Li, with $3$ electrons
	- these can be in the ground state: $1s^{2}$ (two electrons with $s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \hbar$), and another will be in $2s^{1}$
	- where, $2s$ is the label of state and $^1$ is the number of electrons
