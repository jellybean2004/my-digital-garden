- in the examples before (infinite well, harmonic oscillator), the wavefunction describes the system, where each wavefunction corresponds to a single energy of the system
- the wavefunction needs to satisfy some properties:
	- finite, single-valued, differentiable
	- its modulus squared must be integrable with a finite integral
- it was related to the chance of finding a particle in a specific position
