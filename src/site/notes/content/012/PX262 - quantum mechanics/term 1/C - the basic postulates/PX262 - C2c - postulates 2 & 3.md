> [!quote] postulate 2
> every dynamical variable may be represented by a hermitian operator whose eigenvalues represent the possible results of carrying out the measurement of the value of the dynamical variable
> immediately after such a measurement, the wavefunction of the system is identical to the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue obtained as a result of the measurement

> [!quote] postulate 3
> the operators representing the position and the momentum of a particle are$\vec r$ and $-i\hbar\vec\nabla$, respectively
> operators reprseneting other dynamical quantities bear the same functional relation to these, as do the corresponding classical quantities to the classical position and momentum variables
