- if two operators commute, they are called *compatible operators*
- for two compatible operators, $\hat Q, \hat R$ and a generic wave function: $\psi = \sum_{n}a_{n}\phi_{n}$
- take $\phi_{n}$ to be the eigenstate of $\hat Q:$ $\hat Q\hat R \phi_{n} = \hat R \hat  Q \phi_{n} = \hat R q_{n}\phi_{n} = q_{n}\hat R\phi_{n}$
- so, if operators are compatible, then $\hat R\phi_{n}$ is an eigenfunction of $\hat Q$
