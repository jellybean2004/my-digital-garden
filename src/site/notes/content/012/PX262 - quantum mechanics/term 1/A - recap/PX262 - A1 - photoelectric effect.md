- the experimental observation that when light strikes a metal surface, electrons are emitted
- the energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the incident light, but not on its intensity
- the maximum energy: 
$$E = h\,\nu-\phi$$
	- where, 
		$h=$ planck's constant
		$\nu=$ frequency of incident light
		$\phi=$ work function

- the number of electron emitted is proportional to the intensity of the incident light

- in classical physics, the energy of the wave depends on its intensity
- einstein suggested that light is *quantized* in small portions called photons
- each photon has an energy, $E = h\,\nu \implies$ higher light intensity means more photons with the same energy
- objects that in classical physics are waves can behave as particles
	- eg: visible light with a wavelength, $\lambda=550\,nm$, has a energy, $E=\frac{h\,c}{\lambda} \approx 3.6\times10^{-19}\,J$

- in QM, units of $eV$ are often used
	- $1\,eV=1.602\times10^{-19}\,J$
	- for a green photon, $E = 2.26\,eV$

- also, the reduced planck's constant: 
  $$\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}=1.055\times10^{-34}\,Js^{-1}$$
- units:

| energy   | $eV$   |
| -------- | ------ |
| momentum | $eV/c$ |
- $\hbar\,c=197\,eV\,nm$
- for a green photon: $E= 2\pi\frac{\hbar\,c}{\lambda} = 2.26\,eV$
