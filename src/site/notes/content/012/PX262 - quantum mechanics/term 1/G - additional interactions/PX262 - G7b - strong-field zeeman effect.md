- the interaction energy operator:
$$\hat H _{Z}  = \frac{e}{2m}B_{0} (\hat L_{z} + 2 \hat S_{z})$$
- starting with a large external magnetic field, so, effects of LS-coupling can be neglected
- here, simple products of  the eigenfunctions of $\hat L_z$ and $\hat S_z$ are also eigenfunctions of $\hat H'$
- the energy eigen values are changed by:
$$\Delta E = \frac{e\hbar B}{2m} (m_{l}+ 2m_{s})$$
	where, $l$ and $s$ subscripts distinguish the quantum numbers associated with the z components of the two angular momenta

- if an electron in a state with a fixed $l$ is taken, the energy levels will split to $(2l+1)(2s+1)$ levels
- they will all be equally spaced, but some might accidentally be degenerate
