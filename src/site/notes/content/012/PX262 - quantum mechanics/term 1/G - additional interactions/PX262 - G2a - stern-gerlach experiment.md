- a beam of atoms is passed through an inhomogeneous magnetic field
- a force acts on the atom, directing  it towards a position with smaller interaction energy
- if an atom with $\mu_z$ is placed in a magnetic field directed along $z$, such that the field is a function of $z$, the force that acts on it is:
$$F = - \mu_{z} \frac{\partial B}{\partial z}$$
- the **stern-gerlach experiment** makes use of this effect to measure atomic magnetic moments 
- the force exerted by the inhomogeneous field causes the beam to be deflect by an amount proportional to the component of their magnetic moments in the transverse place
- for atoms with an electrons with an orbital quantum number, $l$, a split into $2l+1$ parts is expected, and for $l=0$, there should be no splitting
- experimentally, it is seen that a $l=1$ beam splits into 4, and $l=0$ beam splits to 2

| $l$ | expected <br>$m=2l+1$ | actual |
| --- | --------------------- |:------:|
| $0$ | $1$ <br>(no split)    |  $2$   |
| $1$ | $3$                   |  $4$   |

- the splitting of $l=0$ beam implies that the atom possesses a magnetic moment whose $z$-component can adopt two opposite orientations with respect to the field
- the ground state of hydrogen has no angular momentum: $n=1\implies l=0 \implies L = \sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar = 0$
- so, this cannot be associated with the orbital motion of the electron

- to resolve this, an additional property of particles, called the [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/term 1/G - additional interactions/PX262 - G2b - spin\|spin]], was introduced

- adding angular momenta:
$$l_{1} \oplus l_{2} = l_{1}+l_{2}, l_{1}+l_{2}-2 , \dots,  |l_{1}-l_{2}|$$
- in the [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/term 1/G - additional interactions/PX262 - G2a - stern-gerlach experiment\|stern-gerlach experiment]], the orbital angular momentum and spin should be added
- for $l=1$, $s=0:$
$$l \oplus s = [l+s, |l-s|] = \frac{3}{2},\frac{\;1}{2}$$
- there will be 4 values for that $z$-projection: $+3/2, +1/2, -1/2, -3/2$
- thus, it can be concluded that an electron as spin $1/2$

- spin can take integer or half integer values: $n, n/2$
