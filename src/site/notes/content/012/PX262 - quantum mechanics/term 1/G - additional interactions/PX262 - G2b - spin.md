- **spin** is the *intrinsic* angular momentum associated with a particle
	- *intrinsic* refers to a fundamental property, like mass or charge

- spin is often analogised using the angular momenta for the motion of the earth:
	- orbital angular momentum is associated with its motion around the earth
	- spin angular momentum is associated with it spinning in its axis
- however, articles do not actually spin like the earth, as this would contradict special relativity by speeds faster than $c$

- Dirac showed that quantum mechanics and relativity can be made consistent only if electron is assumed to be a point particle that possesses spin
