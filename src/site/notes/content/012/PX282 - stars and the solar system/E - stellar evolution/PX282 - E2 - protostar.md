## collapse
- eventually, the cloud collapses and a star on the pre-main-sequence is formed
- the gravitational timescale: 
$$\tau_{dyn} = \sqrt{\frac{R^{3}}{2GM}} \sim 10^6\,years$$
- the angular momentum needs to be overcome, which happens via:
	- accretion discs
	- jets
	- rotating stars
## deuterium fusion
- after the initial collapse, there will be deuterium burning and the core temperature will be, $T_{C}\sim10^{6}\,K:$ 
$${}^{2}_{1} \text{H} + {}^{1}_{1} \text{H} \to {}^{3}_{2} \text{He} + \gamma$$
- deuterium is easier to fuse as it does not require a proton decaying into a neutron
- this forms a protostar
- after the freefall collapse, the remaining pre-main-sequence lifetime involves the star adapting to thermal energy: 
$$\tau_{kH} = \frac{GM^{2}}{2RL} \sim 10^{7}\,years$$
- although the core gets hotter, the outer regions have to lose heat to be able to collapse
