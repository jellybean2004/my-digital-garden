- a helium core and a hydrogen-burning shell
- core exhausted hydrogen first as it has a higher temperature
- the shell feeds the core with helium
- core grows until thermal pressure cannot support it
- the core is inert and isothermal with no luminosity coming out of it
- from [[content/012/PX282 - stars and the solar system/E - stellar evolution/PX282 - E3 - main sequence#^4635d4\|here]], it is known that $L \propto \frac{dT}{dr} \implies \frac{dT}{dr} = 0:$ isothermal
- eventually, the core collapses and becomes degenerate, triggering the red giant branch
- **note:** if ${} M>2\,M_{odot} {}$, $He$ can fuse before degeneracy
