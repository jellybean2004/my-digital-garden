- stars are born with the same mass distribution: 
$$f(M)\,dM \propto M^{-\gamma} \, dM$$
	where, $\gamma \approx 2.4$
- if the exponent is less than zero, there will be more low mass stars due to cloud fragment
- but massive stars have higher luminosity, so they produce more of the observed light
