- considering the motion of three bodies
- generally, there is no analytical solution, and it is chaotic

- there are exceptions, such as the **restricted three body problem**, where the mass of third object is negligible

- stable orbits in ***roche potential*** at ***lagrangian points*** where the gravitational potential is locally flat (in rotating frame)
- eg: $L_1$ and $L_{2}$ in earth-sun system is often used for space telescopes

- **tadpole** and **horseshoe** orbits vibrate around the  $L_{4}$ and $L_5$ points
- eg: trojan asteroids in jupiter-sun system

- approximate sphere of influence around the second body where orbits can be stable, called the **hill sphere***
- moons must be well within the hill sphere
