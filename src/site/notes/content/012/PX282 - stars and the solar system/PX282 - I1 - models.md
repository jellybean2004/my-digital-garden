## greeks
 - the solar system appears ***geocentric*** (earth centered) except for occasional ***retrograde*** motion of planets (moving backwards on their paths)

- this was explained by ptolemy with **epicycles***, which is the circular motion around an average circular motion

## copernicus
- copernicus (1543) proposed the ***heliocentric*** model (sun centered), 
- it is simpler, with a natural explanation of retrograde motion (as the earth overtakes other planets)
- this was highly controversial, and it still needed epicycles as it assumed circular orbits

## kepler
- kepler developed three laws to fit precise observations by tycho brahe

>[!note] kepler's first law
>a planet orbits the sun in an **ellipse**, with the sun at a **focus** of the ellipse

>[!note]
>a line connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals
