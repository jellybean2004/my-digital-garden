- photons are released from nuclear-energy production, which do not get out easily
- these photons are absorbed by material progressively further from the core in a random 'walk'
- energy is transferred by photons, convection, atom collisions, magnetic field
- the photons seen arise from near the 'surface', from material in thermal equilibrium
- emission from a gas in thermal equilibrium can be approximated by [[content/011/PX158 - astronomy/PX158 - F - blackbody and colours/PX158 - F1 - black body radiation\|black body radiation]], which follows planck's law: 
$$B_\lambda(T) = \frac{2hc^{2}}{\lambda^{5}}\left(\frac{1}{\exp(\frac{hc}{\lambda kT})}-1\right)$$

- **key observations:**
	- hotter objects have a higher peak, ie. they give off more energy
	- total energy under the curve is: 
	
	$$\int_{0}^{\lambda}B_{\lambda}(T)\,d\lambda = \frac{\sigma T^{4}}{\pi}$$
		where, $\sigma$ is the stefan-botzmann constant
	- at peak $\lambda$, ie: at$\frac{dB}{d\lambda} =0$, the *wien's displacement law*: 
	$$\lambda_{max} T = 2.898\times10^{-3}Km$$
	- as $T\uparrow$, $\lambda\downarrow$
- consider the units of $B_{\lambda}:$ 
$$[B_{\lambda}] = \underbrace{Js^{-1}}_{energy\,rate} \times \underbrace{m^{-2}}_{per\,unit\,area} \times \underbrace{nm^{-1}}_{per\,unit\,\lambda} \times \underbrace{st^{-1}}_{per\,steradian}$$
