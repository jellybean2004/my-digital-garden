- to get $N$ in each ionization state ($N_{I}$, $N_{II}$), the **saha equation** is used: 
$$\frac{N_{i+1}}{N_{i}} = \frac{2}{n_{e}} \frac{U_{i+1}}{U_{i}} \left(\frac{2\pi m_{e}k_{B}}{h^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\exp\left(-\frac{\chi_{i}}{k_{B}T}\right)$$
	where,
	 $n_{e}=$ number of free electrons: the more there are, the easier it is to recombine
	 $\frac{2\pi m_{e}k_{B}}{h^{2}}=$ a constant that involves comparing electron quantum energy to thermal energy
	 $-\chi_{i}=$ energy needed to ionize from $i$ to $i+1$, eg: $\chi_{1}(H)=-13.6\,eV$
