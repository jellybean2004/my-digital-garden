- the **optical depth**, $\tau_{\lambda}$, is defined as: 
$$d\tau_{\lambda}= \kappa_{\lambda} \rho\,dz$$
- taking the integral: 
$$\tau_{\lambda} = \int_{0}^{z} \kappa_{\lambda} \rho\,dz $$
- from the [[content/012/PX282 - stars and the solar system/C - stellar atmosphere/C5-8 - stellar atmospheres/PX282 - C6b - intensity after absorption\|absorption equation:]] 
$$\frac{I}{I_{o}}= e^{-\tau_{\lambda}}$$
- for $\tau = 0,\; I = I_{0} \implies$ no absorption
- as $\tau$ increases, $I$ decreases
- so, the optical depth, $\tau$, is higher in a more absorbing material

- in stars, and observations, the optical depth is **a measure of how far into a material can be seen**
- therefore, it can be said that the surface of the sun is at a constant $\tau$, say $\tau=1$
- if $\kappa$ is low, it means that the material is more transparent, and if it is high, then the material is more opaque
