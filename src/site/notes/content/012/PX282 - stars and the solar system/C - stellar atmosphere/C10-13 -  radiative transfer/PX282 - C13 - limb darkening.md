- the limb of a star, ie. the boundary disc, is seen to be dimmer and redder
- this is due to the temperature gradient within the photosphere
- when looking at a star, the light from the centre region is coming radially outwards and originate from deep in the photosphere
- the light from the limbs are coming at an angle and the originate from the upper reaches of the photosphere
- since the temperature increases further down, the light from the centre is less red and more intense
