- the two main factors controlling line strength are:
	- **excitation:** thermal energy excites electrons to higher energy states
	- **ionization:** electrons gain enough energy to escape the nuclear well

- eg: for H, the **ionization energy** is $-13.6\,eV$, ie: if an electron absorbs more than that, it escapes
- the number of electron in any state are given by the **boltzmann equation**
