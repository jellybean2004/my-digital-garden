- consider  ray of light, which has a specific intensity, $I_\lambda$ (specific because it is in a specific wavelength range, $\lambda\to\lambda+d\lambda$), at an angle, $\theta$, with the $z$-axis
- $I_\lambda$ depends on the direction, the location, and the wavelength
- the flux, $F$, is the energy rate in a direction per unit area
- in the z-direction: 
$$F_{\lambda}= \int_{\Omega}I_{\lambda}\cos\theta\,d\Omega$$
- it can also be thought of as the energy received per unit **steradian**: 
$$dE_\lambda = I_{\lambda}\cos\theta A\,dt\,d\lambda\,d\Omega$$
- for blackbody radiation, $I_{\lambda}=B_\lambda$ (the planck function)
