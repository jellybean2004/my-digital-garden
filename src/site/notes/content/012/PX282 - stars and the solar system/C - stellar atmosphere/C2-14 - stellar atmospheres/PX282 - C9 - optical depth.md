- the **optical depth**, $d\tau$, is defined by: 
$$d\tau_{\lambda}= \kappa_{\lambda} \rho\,dz$$
- taking the integral: 
$$\tau_{\lambda} = \int_{0}^{z} \kappa_{\lambda} \rho\,dz $$
- from the absorption equation: 
$$\frac{I}{I_{o}}= e^{-\tau_{\lambda}}$$
- for $\tau = 0,$ there is no absorption, and $\tau$ increases in a more absorbing material

- in stars, and observations, the optical depth is **a measure of how far into a material can be seen**
- it can be said that the surface of the sun is at a constant $\tau$

- if $\kappa$ is low, it means that the material is more transparent, and if it is high, then the material is more opaque
