- $(1):$ $H^{-}$ opacity rises steeply as the number of free electrons rises with $T$, which are needed to make $H^{-}$
	- this is a combined opacity, ie:  average across wavelength and opacity sources
- $(2):$ for medium temperatures, $T\sim10^{5}\,K$, kramer's law: $\kappa \propto \rho T^\frac{-7}{2}$ 
	- driven by b-f and f-f absorption
- $(3):$ high temperature
	- all electrons are free, and everything is ionized
	- converges to a constant
	- thomson scattering coefficient
