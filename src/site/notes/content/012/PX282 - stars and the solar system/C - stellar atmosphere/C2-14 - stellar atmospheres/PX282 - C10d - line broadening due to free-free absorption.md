- follows *kramer's law*: 
$$\kappa \propto \rho T^{- \frac{7}{2}}$$
- this shows that the constant depends on the composition of the material
- consider a free electron: 
$$E = \sqrt{m_{e}c^{2}+ p_{\gamma} c^{2}}$$
- the momentum of the photon is transferred to the electron
- it is only solvable if $m_{e}=0$, or $p_{\gamma}=0$, neither of which are physically possible
