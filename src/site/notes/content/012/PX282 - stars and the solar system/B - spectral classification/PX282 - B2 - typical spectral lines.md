- typical spectral lines include $H$, $He$, ionized metals, and metals
	- in astronomy, metals are everything but $H$ or $He$
- $H$ and metals occupy most of the spectrum
- $He$ and ionized metals occupy the hot end, ie: shorter wavelength

- when stars are too hot:
	- $H$ is ionized, therefore there are no absorption lines from it (no electron)
	- $He$ has very tightly bound electron, which needs high temperature to raise from the ground state, which allows absorption at visible wavelengths
	- metals get ionized at high temperatures, and are very prevalent for sun-like stars

- when stars are too cold:
	- $H$ has a few electrons in $n=2$ state
	- **balmer lines**, which are in the visible range, need electrons in $n=2$ state to be visible
	- **lyman lines**, which are formed, are in UV
	- molecules are seen only in the coolest stars, as hotter stars break them up

- **key points:**
	- temperature controls the lines seen, through excitation and ionization
	- if lines are not seen, it does not mean that an element is not present
