- from spectral lines, subdivisions are formed: $G0 \to G9\, (hot\to cold)$
- the sun is a $G2$ star

- there is also a '**luminosity class**', divided according to the **width of spectral lines**
- high gravity changes the width as high pressure causes **pressure broadening**
- this gives information about the radius of the star as small radius means high pressure, and therefore, wider lines
- they are labelled with roman numerals as follows:
	- $I\to IV:$ giants
	- $V:$ main sequence (dwarfs)
	- $VI:$ sub-dwarfs
	- $D:$ white dwarfs
- eg: $AOV$(dwarf), $AOI$ (giant)
