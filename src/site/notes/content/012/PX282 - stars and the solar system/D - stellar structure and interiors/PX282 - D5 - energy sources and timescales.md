$$\text{timescale} = \frac{\text{quantity}}{\text{rate of change}}$$
## gravitational timescale
- $\Omega$ is a dynamical time scale: 
$$\tau_{dyn} = \frac{R_{*}}{v_{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{R^{3}}{2GM}}$$
	where, $v_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$ is the escape velocity
- for the sun: $\tau_{dyn} \approx 1000\,s$, which is the time for the sun to collapse if all other forces are removed
- therefore, it relevant for supernovae
## thermal timescale
- from the [[content/012/PX282 - stars and the solar system/D - stellar structure and interiors/PX282 - D4 - energy in stars#^b7947e]\|virial theorem]]: 
$$U = - \frac{\Omega}{2} \approx \frac{GM^{2}}{2R}$$
$$\tau_{KH } = \frac{U}{L} = \frac{GM^{2}}{2RL}$$
	where, $KH$ stands for kelvin-holmholtz
 - for the sun: $\tau_{KH} = 1.5\times10^{7}\,yr$
 - it is known that stars are more than $10^{9}$ years old
 - hence, thermal energy cannot be the key energy source
 - $\tau_{KH}$ is relevant for stars collapsing during formation
## nuclear timescale
$$\tau_{N} = \frac{E_{N}}{L}$$
- the nuclear energy: 
$$E_{N} = \eta X m_{core}c^{2}$$
	where, 
		$\eta=$ efficiency,
		$X =$ $H$ mass fraction,
		$m_{core}=$ mass available for fusion,
- eg: $\eta \approx 0.007$, $X \approx 0.7$, $m_{core} \approx 0.1\,M:$ 
$$\therefore \tau_{N} \approx 7\times10^{9} \text{years}$$
- this shows that nuclear energy drives the main-sequence lifetime
