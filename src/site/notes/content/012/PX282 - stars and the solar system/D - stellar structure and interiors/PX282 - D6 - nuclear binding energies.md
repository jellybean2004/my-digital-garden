- the energy of an atom: 
$$E = mc^{2} \neq (Z\,m_{p} + N\,m_{n}) \, c^{2}$$
	where, $m$ is the rest mass of the atom, $Z$ and $m_{p}$ are the number and mass of protons, and $N$ and $m_{n}$ are the number and mass of neutrons
- this inequality shows that there is an energy difference, called the 'binding energy' 
$$E_{nucleus} < E_{p} + E_{n}$$
- the binding energy is the amount of energy required to separate the components of an atom: 
$$E_{binding} = (Z\,m_{p} + N\,m_{n} - m_{nucleus}) \, c^{2}$$

- consider a fusion reaction: 
$$4 \, {}_{1}^{1}\text{H} \to {}_{2}^{4} \text{He}$$
- the energy released: $\Delta E = 0.0084\,m_{H}$ per nucleon
- going past $He$ gives energy, whereas going past $Fe$ costs energy
- $Fe$ is the most tightly bound per nucleon
- eg: ${}_{6}^{12}C,\; 6p,\; 6n$
	- using the atomic mass unit: $u = 931.494\,MeV\,c^{-2} = 1.6605\times10^{-27}\,kg$
	- $m_{p} = 1.007276\,u$ and $m_{n} = 1.008665\,u$
	- the mass of individual nucleons: $6\,m_{p} + 6\,m_{n} = 12.095646\,u$
	- the mass of the atom: $m_{atom} = 11.9967\,u$
	- the mass difference: $\Delta = 0.09895\,u = 92.2\,MeV\,c^{-2}$
	- the binding energy: $BE = 92.2\,MeV$
- eg: 
$$3\,{}_{2}^{4} \text{He} \to {}_{6}^{12}\text{C}$$
	- $\Delta = 0.0111\,u$
	- $BE = 10.3\,MeV$
