## energy generation conservation
- considering the energy generation rate per unit mass in the shell, $\epsilon [Js^{-1}kg^{-1}]$
- the mass of the shell: $dM = 4\pi r^{2}\rho\,dr$
- the energy from the shell: $E = 4\pi r^{2} \rho\epsilon\,dr$
$$\frac{dL_{r}}{dr} = 4\pi r^{2}\rho\epsilon$$
## energy transport
- energy must flow from the core to the surface of a star as the core temperature will be higher that the surface temperature
- the primary mechanisms in which this happens:
	- radiation
	- convection
