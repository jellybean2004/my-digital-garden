- a **stream line** is a curve, generally in 3D, which at a fixed time at each location is tangential to the fluid velocity, $\vec u$
- let $d\vec r$ be parallel to a stream line, ie: $d\vec r \parallel \vec u$ , or, $d\vec r = d\lambda \vec u$, where $d\lambda$ is a small scalar
	$dx = d\lambda u_x$
	$dy = d\lambda u_y$
	$dz = d\lambda u_z$
$$d\lambda = \frac{dx}{u_{x}}= \frac{dy}{u_{y}} = \frac{dz}{u_{z}}$$
- the solution to the above differential equations describe stream lines
