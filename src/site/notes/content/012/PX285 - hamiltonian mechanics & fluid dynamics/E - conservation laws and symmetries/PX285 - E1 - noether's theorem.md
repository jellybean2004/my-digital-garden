- for each symmetry of the system, there is a conserved quantity:
	- [[content/012/PX285 - hamiltonian mechanics & fluid dynamics/E - conservation laws and symmetries/PX285 - E2 - translation of space\|translation of space]] : conservation of linear momentum
	- [[content/012/PX285 - hamiltonian mechanics & fluid dynamics/E - conservation laws and symmetries/PX285 - E3 - translation in time\|translation in time]] : conservation of energy
	- [[content/012/PX285 - hamiltonian mechanics & fluid dynamics/E - conservation laws and symmetries/PX285 - E4 - rotation of space\|rotation of space]] : conservation of angular momentum
