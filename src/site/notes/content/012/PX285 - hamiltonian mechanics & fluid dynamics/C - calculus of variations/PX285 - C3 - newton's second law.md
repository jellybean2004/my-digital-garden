- in newtonian mechanics: 
$$L = T-V = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}- V(x)$$
- the first term of the euler-lagrange equation: 
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = F$$
	where, $F$, the force is given by the negative potential gradient
- the second term: 
$$- \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v} = -\frac{d}{dt}(mv) = - \frac{dp}{dt}$$
	where, $p$ is the momentum
- therefore, the euler-lagrange equation gives: 
$$F= \frac{dp}{dt}$$
- the above relation is *newton's second law*
