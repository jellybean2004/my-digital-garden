- taking $L(x,\dot x)$, the hamiltonian is defined as: 
$$H = T+V$$
- $T+V$ for a system is usually defined as energy, $E$
- therefore, *the conservation for energy* is stated as: 
$$H=E$$
- if energy is conserved, $\frac{dH}{dt}=0$, ie: $H$ is a constant of motion: 
$$\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \frac{dH}{dt}\,dt = H(t_{1})-H(t_{0}) =0$$
- constant energy is also defined as '**an integral of the motion**'
- this only contains the first-order time derivatives of the coordinates, whereas the euler-lagrange equation is second-order

- **a none on notation:**
	- $H$ is used, in place of $E$, because it is reserved for the expression of energy in terms of coordinates
	- $E$ stands for the constant value it keeps
