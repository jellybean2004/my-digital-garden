## opposite directions

- considering two vortex lines, $A$ and $B$, separated by a distance, $d$, rotating in opposite directions
- the streamline of $A$  generates a flow at location of $B$
- this leads to a force: ${} \vec F_{21} = \rho \vec u_{1}\times \vec K_{2} {}$, which will be directed towards $A$

- $B$ rotates in the irrotational rotation of $A$, at a distance $d$, 
$$\begin{gather}
A: u_{\theta} = \frac{K}{2\pi r} \\
\text{at }B: u_{\theta} = \frac{K}{2\pi d}
\end{gather}$$

$$u_{\theta}(1) > u_{\theta}(2) \implies P(1) < P(2)$$
- likewise, $A$ is pushed towards vortex $B$
- but this is just the initial phase of the vortex interaction
- the velocity caused by the magnus force causes another magnus force
- the pair of vortices drift in the $y$-direction
- the drift becomes steady
$$u_{drift} = \frac{K}{2\pi d}$$
- this speed is exactly the speed of the flow of A at B
- since there is no shear, there is no magnus effect, no acceleration, and therefore the motion is steady
- thus, the vortices are not attracted towards each other
## same direction

- now considering that the vortices are rotating in the same direction
- initially, they repel each other
- the vortices rotate around the axis between them
