- considering two symmetric vortices rotating oppositely
- after a while, the flow becomes asymmetric (eg: thermal fluctuations)

- a street of vortices, known as von karmen street, is formed
- the vortices rotating in alternate sense are shed from either side of the cylinder
- the size of each vortex near the cylinder is similar to the diameter of the cylinder
- the parameters of the process:
	- $D:$ diameter of cylinder (and vortices)
	- $u:$ flow speed upstream
	- $P:$ time period of  vortex shedding
- a dimensionless combination of these parameters can be formed, which is called the **'struhal number'**:
$$\text{St} = \frac{D}{Pu}$$
- for a very broad range of applications (air, water, mercury, plasma), $\text{St} \approx 0.25$
- this is a very robust feature of the oscillating vortex shedding phenomenon
- as vortices have mass and momentum, the periodic vortex shedding imparts a force on the cylinder

- the force changes direction periodically
- therefore, the cylinder oscillates in the direction perpendicular to the flow velocity

- further downstream, the vortices are observed to break into smaller vortices, in a process called **'nonlinear cascade'**
- they can also collide and merge giving a 'gas' or a 'soup' of vortices of different sizes
- this is **'turbulence'**
- if a snapshot is taken and the sizes of the vortices are plotted as a histogram,
