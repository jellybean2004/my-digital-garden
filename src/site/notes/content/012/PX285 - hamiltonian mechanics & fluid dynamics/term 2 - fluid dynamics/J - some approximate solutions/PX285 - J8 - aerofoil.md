- in the reference frame of aerofoil
- assuming air is incompressible
- applying [[content/012/PX285 - hamiltonian mechanics & fluid dynamics/term 2 - fluid dynamics/J - some approximate solutions/PX285 - J1a - bernoulli's principle from conservation of energy\|bernoulli's principle]] along the top streamline:
$$P_{f} + \frac{1}{2} \rho u_{f}^{2} = P_{t} + \frac{1}{2} \rho u_{t}^{2}$$
- and, along the bottom streamline:
$$P_{f} + \frac{1}{2} \rho u_{f}^{2} = P_{b} + \frac{1}{2} \rho u_{b}^{2}$$
- subtracting:
$$P_{b} - P_{t} = \frac{\rho}{2} (u_{t}^{2} - u_{b}^{2}) $$
- this gives the lift if the $LHS>0$, ie: $u_{t} > u_{b}$

- a common mistake is that since the top path is longer than the bottom path, $u_{t} > u_{b}$
- this assumes that the arrival times must be the same, but they are not the same
