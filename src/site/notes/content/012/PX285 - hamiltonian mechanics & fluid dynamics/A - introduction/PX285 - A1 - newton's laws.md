## first law 
- a body stays in a state of constant motion unless acted upon by an external force
$$\vec v = constant \,(\vec F=0)$$
## second law
- force is rate of change of momentum 
$$\vec F = m\,\vec a$$
## third law
- to every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
$$\sum\limits_{i}\vec F_{i}=0$$

- for a mass, $m$, with $\vec g\sim-\hat z$, the force is: $-m\,g\,\hat z = m \ddot{\vec z}$   
$$\begin{align*}
	-m\,g &= m\,\ddot{z} \\
	\int \ddot z \,dt &= \int - g\,dt \\
	\dot z &= -g\,t + v_{0} \\
	\int \dot z\, dt &= \int (-g\,t +v_{0})\,dt \\
	z(t) &= - \frac{1}{2}g\,t + v_{0}\,t + z_{0}
\end{align*}$$
