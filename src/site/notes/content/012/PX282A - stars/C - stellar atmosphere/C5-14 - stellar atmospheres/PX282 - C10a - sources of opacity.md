- any photon passing within an area of a particle can be absorbed or scattered in the following ways:
	- **bound-bound absorptions:** photons with the exact energy as the electron energy level gaps will be absorbed by energy level transitions
	- **bound-free absorptions:** photons with sufficient energy will ionise the particles and get absorbed
	- **free-free absorptions:** free electrons absorb photons and gain momenta
	- **scattering:** by free or bound electrons, eg: thomson, compton, rayliegh, etc
