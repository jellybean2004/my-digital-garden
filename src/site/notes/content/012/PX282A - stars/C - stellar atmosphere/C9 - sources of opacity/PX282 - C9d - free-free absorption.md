- it follows *kramer's law*: 
$$\kappa \propto \rho T^{- 7/2}$$
- this shows that the constant depends on the composition of the material
- consider a free electron near an ion that absorbs an electron
- the ion is needed to provide energy and momentum, without which conservation of energy-momentum becomes impossible

- conserving momentum:
$$p_{\gamma}= p_{e}$$
- conserving energy:
$$\begin{gather}
 m_{e}c^{2} + p_{\gamma}c= \sqrt{m^{2}_{e}c^{4}+ p_{e}^{2} c^{2}} \\\\
 m_{e}^{2}c^{4} + p_{\gamma}^{2}c^{2} + 2m_{e}p_{\gamma}c^{3} = m^{2}_{e}c^{4}+ p_{e}^{2} c^{2} \\
\implies 2m_{e}p_{\gamma}c^{3} =0
\end{gather}$$
- it is only solvable if $m_{e}=0$, or $p_{\gamma}=0$, neither is physically possible
- thus, additonal energy/momentum is needed to allow this interaction

- the time an electron is in proximity to an ion $\propto v^{-3}$
- from the [[content/011/PX156 - quantum phenomena/PX156A - quantum phenomena/PX156 - A - light/PX156 - A3c - boltzmann distribution\|boltzmann distribution]]: 
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2k_{B}T }{m}} \implies v\propto T^{1/2}$$
- therefore, the number of systems able to absorb $\propto \rho T^{-1/2}$
- the absorption coefficient for a single system $\propto \nu_\gamma^{-3}$
- compiling above relations:
$$\kappa \propto \nu^{-3}\rho T^{-1/2}$$
- most absorption happens at the peak of the planck function, $B(T):$
$$\therefore \kappa \propto \rho T^{-7/2}$$
