## rayliegh scattering
- generally, on atoms for low energy photons 
- it is elastic, ie: $E_{\gamma}$ is constant
$$\sigma_{R} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^{4}}$$
	where, $\sigma$ is the cross-section
- it causes the sky to be blue during the day, and red/yellow during dawn/dusk
## compton scattering
[[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/term 1/A - recap/PX262 - A2 - compton scattering\|PX262 - A2 - compton scattering]]
- on electrons
- inelastic, ie: $E_\gamma$ changes
## thomson scattering
- on electrons
- elastic, ie: $E_\gamma$ is constant
- it is the low-energy limit of compton
- the most important as all observations are in this range
$$\sigma_{T} =\frac{8\pi}{3} \left(\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi m_{e}c^{2}}\right)^{2} = 6.7\times10^{-29}\,m^{2}$$
- the cross-section has no $\lambda$ dependence
