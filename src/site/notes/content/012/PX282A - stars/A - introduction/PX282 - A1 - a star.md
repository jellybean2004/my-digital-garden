- a body bound by self-gravity
- radiates energy from an internal source
- massive enough for nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms
	*this is a working definition, details are complex*

- the baseline of the knowledge of stars comes from the sun
	- spherical(ish), ie: self-bound
	- the effective temperature, $T_{eff}\approx 5780\,K$
	- the radius, $R_{\odot}\approx 4\times10^{8}\,m\approx110\,R_{\oplus}$
	- the mass, $M_{\odot}=2\times10^{30}\,kg\approx1.7\times10^{6}\,M_{\oplus}$
	- age $\approx4.6\,Gyr$ (from the age of the oldest moon rocks)
	- rotation period $\approx 27\,days$
