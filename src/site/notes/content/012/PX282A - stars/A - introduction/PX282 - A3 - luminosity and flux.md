- see [[content/011/PX158 - astronomy/PX158 - D - fluxes and magnitudes/PX158 - D1 - luminosity and flux\|PX158 - D1 - luminosity and flux]]

- physical properties of a star:
	- **fundamental premises**: mass, radius, temperature, luminosity
	- **observable quantities:** magnitude/brightness, colour/spectrum
### luminosity, $L$
- it is the energy transfer/total energy emitted by an object
- units: $[Js^{-1}]$
### flux, $F$
- **note:** 
	- $F$ is flux on the surface of star
	- $f$ is flux at a distance, $d$/the observed flux

- it is the energy emitted per unit area/energy flux through a 3D surface
- units: $[Js^{-1}m^{-2}]$
- luminosity can be written as: 
$$L = 4\pi\, R_{*}^{2}\,F$$
	where, both $L$ and $F$ are across all $\lambda$
- at a distance, $d$, the flux is given by: 
$$f = \frac{L}{4\pi\,d^{2}} = F \left(\frac{R}{d}\right)^{2}$$
- for the sun, $f=1370\,Js^{-1}m^{-2}$, $d=1\,AU$, $R_{\odot}= 7\times10^{8}\,m$ 
	- $F = 6.3\times10^{7}\,Js^{-1}m^{-2}$
	- $L= 3.9\times10^{26}\,Js^{-1}$

- $d$ is very important as it gives information about: 
	- where stars are
	- how bright stars intrinsically are
