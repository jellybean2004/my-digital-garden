- higher mass stars 'burn out' of hydrogen faster
- clusters of stars are groups that formed at about the same time, from the same cloud
- therefore they will be of the same age, a similar composition, and the same distance
- the hertzsprung-russel diagrams for clusters have less scatter
- the age of a cluster determines what is seen
### pleiades
- a young cluster $\sim 100\,My$r
- low-mass stars have not finished forming
- they are also further, so it may mean that low-mass stars have not been seen
### hyades
- an older cluster $\sim 600\,Myr$
- **turnoff points**
- when stars end their main sequence lifetimes, they move off
- turnoff points can be used to get the age
### globular cluster
- the oldest clusters 
- **blue stragglers:** stars that break the model like binary stars, results of stellar mergers
