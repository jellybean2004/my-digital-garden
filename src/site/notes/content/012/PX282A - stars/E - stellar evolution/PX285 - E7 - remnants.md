- a mass of remnant material is left

- for a star of mass less than $25\,M_{\odot}$, a **neutron star** remains
- they are supported by neutron degeneracy pressure
- the maximum mass is given by the [[content/011/PX158 - astronomy/PX158 - I - stars/PX158 - I7c - chandrashekhar limit\|chandrashekhar limit]] of $\sim 3\,M_\odot$
- typically, they are $1.4\,M_{\odot}$

- if the initial star is much more massive, a **blackhole** is obtained
