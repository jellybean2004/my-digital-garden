- they evolve similarly to low-mass stars, up to [[content/012/PX282A - stars/E - stellar evolution/PX282 - E5e - asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\|AGB]], but they burn faster with no [[content/012/PX282A - stars/E - stellar evolution/PX282 - E5c - helium flash\|helium flash]]
- fusion can continue, potentially up to iron

- **C-burning** 
	- temperature $\sim 6\times10^{8}\,K$ 
	- forms Ne, Na and Mg
	- lasts about $300$ years
- **O-burning**
	- a temperature $\sim 10^{9}\,K$ 
	- forms Si, P, S and Mg
	- lasts about ${} 200$ days
- **Si burning** 
	- forms Fe, 
	- lasts about 2 days 

- a shell structure forms with an  degenerate iron core
- if the mass of the core goes above the [[content/011/PX158 - astronomy/PX158 - I - stars/PX158 - I7c - chandrashekhar limit\|chandrashekhar limit]] $(>1.4\,M_\odot)$, it collapses, resulting in a **supernova**
- this is a gravitational collapse, ie. a free fall timescale
- as the inner core collapses, eventually the strong nuclear force causes a bounce-back
- this causes a substantial energy release of $\sim 10^{46}\,J$
- about 1% of it is kinetic energy released as neutrinos in about $10\,s$
- observationally, such core-collapse supernovae are labelled type $II$, ${} Ib$, ${} Ic$
- the outer layers fall slower and they are suspended over the collapsing core
- a lot happens in a short time
- the core collapses in seconds, while the shockwave takes hours to reach the surface
- a large quantity of $\alpha$-elements is produced
