- H-burning stars in PP chains
- overtime, He builds up in the core
- the average mass per particle in the core goes from $\mu_{H+} = \frac{1}{2}$ to $\mu_{He+}=\frac{4}{3}$
- the pressure: 
$$p = nk_{B}T  = \frac{\rho}{\mu m_{H}}k_{B}T$$
- therefore, as $\mu$ increases, the pressure decreases, and the core gets compressed 
- this leads to the temperature increasing to balance it out, hence the rate of nuclear reaction increases
- the nuclear timescale: 
$$\tau_{N} = \frac{E_{N}}{L} \approx 7\times10^{9}\,years \;\text{(sun)}$$
## scaling law for low mass stars
- the luminosity from energy transfer: 
$$L \propto \frac{r^{2}}{\kappa\rho} T^{3} \frac{dT}{dr} \propto \frac{r^{2}T^{6.5}}{\rho^{2}} \frac{dT}{dr}$$
	- where, $\kappa \propto \rho T^{-3.5}$ from kramer's laws
- therefore: 
$$\frac{dT}{dr} = \frac{T}{R}$$
- where, $\rho\sim \frac{M}{R^{3}}$ and $r\sim R:$ 
$$L \propto \frac{R^{7}T^{7.5}}{M^{2}} \tag{1}$$
- taking the hydrostatic equilibrium equation: 
$$\frac{dP}{dr} = - \frac{GM_{r}}{r^{2}}\rho$$
$$\frac{P}{R}\propto \frac{M^{2}}{R^{5}} \;,\; P \propto \frac{M^{2}}{R^{4}}$$
- for an ideal gas: 
$$P = \frac{\rho}{\mu m_{H}} k_{B}T \propto \frac{M^{2}}{R^{4}} \propto \frac{M}{\mu R^{3}} T$$
$$\implies T\propto \frac{M\mu}{R}$$
- for a constant $T:$ 
$$R \propto M\mu$$
- back to equation $(1):$ 
$$L\propto \mu^{7}M^{5}$$
- so, if $\mu$ increases, the luminosity also increases in main sequence
$$\tau_{N} = D \times \frac{m_{core}c^{2}}{L} \propto \frac{M}{L} \propto M^{-4}$$
- higher mass stars have shorter main-sequence lifetime
