- core contracts from increased mass and the envelope expands, so gravitational potential energy is being dumped into the envelope
- the temperatures of the core and the shell are increasing
- it is known that: 
$$L = 4\pi R^{2}\sigma T_{eff}^{4}$$
- $L$ is set by fusion
- $R$ is increasing
- $T_{eff}$ is decreasing
- the envelope becomes convective with a higher gradient: hot core to colder outer
- at the end of the RGB, the core gets hot enough for He fusion
- so, there is He-burning core, enveloped by a He-shell, enveloped by a H-burning core, enveloped by a H-shell: an onion!
