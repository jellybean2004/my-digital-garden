- $U:$ ultraviolet
- $B:$ blue
- $V:$ visible
- $R:$ red

## difference in magnitudes

- from *[[content/011/PX158 - astronomy/PX158 - D - fluxes and magnitudes/PX158 - D2 - brightness and magnitudes#^6c110f\|here]]*: 
$$m_{B} - m_{R} = -2.5 \log \left(\frac{f_{B}}{f_{R}}\right)$$
- this system is calibrated using vega such that: 
$$(m_{B}-m_{R})_{vega} = 0$$
	- a number greater than 0 means a temperature less than that of vega
	- most stars will have colour $>0$ as vega is a hot star

- the colour is given as: $blue\; filter - red\; filter$
	- eg: $(B-R)$, $(V-R)$, $(V-I)$
- **larger magnitude means lower flux**

- eg $(B-V)=1.83$ for antares, $(B-V)=0.65$ for the sun. which one is hotter? which one is more lumious?
	- $(B-V)_{A}>(B-V)_{\odot} \implies$ larger magnitude of bluer light from antares
	- smaller flux in $B$, more $\lambda_{V}$ from antares
	- $\lambda_{V}>\lambda_{B}$ and ${} T\propto\frac{1}{\lambda}\implies$ antares is colder
	- $L=4\pi R^{2}\sigma T^{4}:$ radius of star is needed to determine the relative luminousity
