- in $1966$, researchers found a microwave signal coming from all directions in the sky
- theorists predicted a cosmic background from $380\,000\,yrs$ after the start of the universe, when it became transparent/optically thin
- for the *CMB*, $z\approx 1000$ , $T\approx 3000\,K$, so the background would be a [[content/011/PX158 - astronomy/PX158 - F - blackbody and colours/PX158 - F1 - black body radiation\|blackbody]], the most perfect blackbody
- at $z=0$, this signal has red shifted to microwave radiation with a  blackbody spectrum at $T=2.73\,K$
- this was evidence for the "*big bang theory*"
