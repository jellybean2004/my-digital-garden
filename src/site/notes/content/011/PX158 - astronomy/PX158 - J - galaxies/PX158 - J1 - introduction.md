- gravitationally bound collection of stars, dust, gas, planets, etc
- in the $1920s$, there was a great debate as to what galaxies were:
	- gas and stars within the milky way
	- 'island universes', other milky way-like structures

- edwin hubble managed to measure the distance to a nearby galaxy ($M31$, andromeda) using *cepheid variables*, which have absolute magnitudes proportional to their pulsation period
- he measured the distance to be $\sim 100\,kpc$ (*cf*: diameter of the milky way: $\sim 30\,kpc$)
