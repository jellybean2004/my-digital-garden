### spiral galaxies
- contain a central region (bulge), and spiral 'arms'
- often contain young (blue) stars 
- eg: milky way, $M31$
### elliptical galaxies
- stars in an elliptical orbit around the centre
- extremely large
- contain old (red) stars
- potentially formed from the merger of spiral galaxies
### irregular galaxies
- indistinct shape
- normally, small
