- in 1718, edmund halley noticed that some 'fixed' stars showed movement
- stars move in orbits around the galactic centre with periods in units of $100s \, Myr$
- proper motion can be observed over years or decades
- typical unit: $\mu$ : $\frac{mas}{year}$
- proper motion in 2D is given as:
	- ${} \mu_{R.A.} :$ right ascension direction
	- $\mu_{Dec}:$ declination direction
- 3D space vector for the motion of a star can be obtained using the doppler shift
