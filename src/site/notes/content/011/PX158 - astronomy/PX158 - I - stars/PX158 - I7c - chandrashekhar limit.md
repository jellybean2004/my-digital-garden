- degenerate objects have a maximum mass above which they collapse
- the gravitational energy: 
$$E_{G} \propto \frac{M}{R}$$
- the degeneracy energy: 
$$\begin{align*}
	E_{d}\propto n_{e}^{\frac{2}{3}} &\propto \left(\frac{M}{R^{3}}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}\\
	\therefore E_{d} &\propto \frac{M^{\frac{2}{3}}}{R^{2}}
\end{align*}$$
- $E_{g}$ exceeds $E_{d}$ with steeper scaling with $M$
- however, $E_{d}$ scales more rapidly with $R$
- hence, if the radius contracts, the balance can be restored

- if $M\uparrow$ and $R\downarrow$, the stars can support themselves
- but eventually, relativistic effects start becoming non-negligible and: 
$$E_{d}\propto \frac{M^{\frac{1}{3}}}{R}$$
- now, $R$ scales similarly as with $E_{g}$, but $M$ does not
- this imbalance cases the $E_{g}$ to dominate, and the star collapses
- the particular mass limit at which this occurs is called the ***chandrashekhar limit***
