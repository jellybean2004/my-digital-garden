- the [[content/011/PX158 - astronomy/PX158 - I - stars/PX158 - I7c - chandrashekhar limit\|chandrashekhar limit]] for a white dwarf is $\sim 1.4\,M_{\odot}$
- electrons are fused with the nuclei of atoms, only neutrons are packed together
- $R_{NS}\approx 10\,km$, $M_{NS} \approx 1.4\,M_{\odot}$, and $\rho_{NS}=10^{18}\,kgm^{-3}$, $g = 2\times10^{12}\,ms^{-2}$

- a drop of one meter$\to 2000\,kms^{-1}$
- from infinity$\to 200\,000\,kms^{-1}= \frac{2}{3}c$
- from a $1mm$ hill$\to$ human lifetime worth of energy
- due to the high $g$, they are very smooth

- spin very rapidly $\sim 700\,rev/s$
- very strong magnetic field $\sim 10^{10}\,T$
- $B$-field can be misaligned to the rotation axis
- this gives rise to '*pulsars*', which were originally known as '*little green men*' (LGM) as they were thought of as aliens
- pulsars have shown:
	- exoplanets around neutron stars
	- test predictions of general relativity (gravitational waves)
