- above the [[content/011/PX158 - astronomy/PX158 - I - stars/PX158 - I7c - chandrashekhar limit\|chandrashekhar limit]] for [[content/011/PX158 - astronomy/PX158 - I - stars/PX158 - I7b - neutron stars\|neutron stars]], there is no escaping collapse into a blackhole
- they are very dense objects
- not even light can escape their gravity

- best described by general relativity
- but the concept can be thought of in newtonian gravity
- there could be objects with escape velocities larger than that of light: 
$$\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{2}mv_{esc}^{2} &= \frac{GMm}{R} \\
	v_{esc}^{2} &= \frac{2GM}{R}
\end{align*}$$
	$M=$ mass of planet/star, $R=$ its radius
- for light: 
$$R = \frac{2GM}{c^{2}}=3\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)\,km$$
	- $R$ is the *schwarzschild radius*
	- for the sun, $R_{schw.}=6\,km$; for the earth, $R_{schw.}=6\,cm$

- blackholes do not radiate (in the conventional sense)

- nothing ever falls directly onto it due to too much angular momentum
- a disc of matter is formed in which gas heats up through friction
- the falling of matter is called *accretion*
- blackholes that accrete are called '*quasars*'
- accretion discs are very luminous
- accretion discs are stable to $\sim \frac{6GM}{c^{2}} = 3R_{schw.}$
- energy released by matter falling into a blackhole: 
$$E_{grav.}= \frac{GMm}{R} = \frac{1}{6}mc^{2}$$
- efficiency	$\approx17\%$ (*cf*: $H$-fusion $\sim 0.7\%$)
