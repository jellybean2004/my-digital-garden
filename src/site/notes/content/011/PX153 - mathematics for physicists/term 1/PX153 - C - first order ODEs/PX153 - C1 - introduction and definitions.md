## ordinary differential equation (ODE)
### definition
- contains *only ordinary derivatives*, no partial derivatives
- *order* of an ODE is the order of the highest derivative
- *degree* of an ODE is the power to which the highest derivative is raised, with all derivatives as integer powers
- so an equation of the form $\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + \frac{dy}{dx} + c = 0$ with solution $y(x)$ is a second order, first degree ODE, where $y$ is a dependent variable, x is an independent variable, and c is a constant
### general solution
- the most general function that satisfies the ODE 
- contains all possible solutions
- the general solution of an $n^{th}$ order ODE will contain $n$ constants of integration which needs $n$ *boundary conditions*
### particular solution
- satisfies the ODE subject to these *boundary conditions*
