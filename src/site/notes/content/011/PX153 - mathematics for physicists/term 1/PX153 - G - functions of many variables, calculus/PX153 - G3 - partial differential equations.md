- eg:
	- wave equation: 
	$$\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial t^{2}} = v^{2} \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}$$
	- diffusion equation, $\phi(x,t)$ is the concentration of diffusing material: 
	$$\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial t^{2}}$$
	- the schr√∂dinger equation: 
	$$\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = \frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2m} \frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial x^{2}} +V\psi$$
