## scalar
- a scalar quantity is defined by its magnitude
- independent of coordinate system
- eg: density, speed
## vector
- has a magnitude and direction
- components depend on the coordinate system
- geometrically, it's an arrow, length proportional to the magnitude
- for vectors, in books, often in bold **v**
- often underlined / with an arrow on top
- magnitude is given by : 
$$ v = |\vec{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}$$
- direction is often described by a unit vector (underlined with a hat on top) 
$$ \underline{\hat{v}} = \frac{\vec{v}}{|\vec{v}|} $$
- any vector can be written as: 
$$ \vec{v} = v \; \underline{\hat{v}}  $$
## vector fields
- describes a vector that varies continuously in space
- eg: wind - has a magnitude (speed) and a direction that vary continuously with position
