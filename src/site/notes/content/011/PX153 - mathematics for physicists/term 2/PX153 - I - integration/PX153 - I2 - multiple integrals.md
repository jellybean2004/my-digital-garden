## introduction

- for two variables, $x$ and $y$, divide the volume enclosed by the function, $f(x,y)$, the $x-y$ plane, and the boundaries into a stack of columns
- the integral is given by the sum of the volumes of those columns as we take the number of columns to infinity and their basis area (cross-section) to zero
- it is suppose $f(x,y)$ is continuous, single-valued for $a \leq x \leq b$ and $c \leq y \leq d$ , ie: the *domain of integration*, $R$
