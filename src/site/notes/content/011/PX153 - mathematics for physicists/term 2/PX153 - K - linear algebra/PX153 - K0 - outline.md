- matrices are arrays of numbers that appear naturally in:
	- systems of linear equations
	- modelling of dynamical systems, best linear approximation, that can be expressed as simultaneous linear equations (eg: coupled pendulums)
	- quantum mechanics
	- computational physics
- outline:
	- inverse matrix
		- for a matrix, $A$, its inverse, such that, $A\,A^{-1}=I$, where $I$ is an identity matrix
	- eigenvalues and eigenvectors
		- ${} A\, \vec x = \lambda\, \vec x {}$, where $\vec x$ and $\lambda$  are the eigenvector and eigenvalue respectively
	- the effect of a matrix, $A$, on a vector space, $\{\vec x\}$
		- $A$ can be thought as a map going from $\{x\}$ to $\{y\}$
