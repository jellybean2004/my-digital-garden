- at discontinuities in a function, the fourier series always overshoots the function by an amount proportional to the size of the discontinuities
- as the number of terms increases, the overshoot moves closer to the discontinuity, but doesn't vanish

- $\delta$ represents the difference, $|f_{N}(x)-f(x)|$
