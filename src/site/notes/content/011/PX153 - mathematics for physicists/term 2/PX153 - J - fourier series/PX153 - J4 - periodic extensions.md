## periodic extension
- can be evaluated for any value of $x$. 
- a fourier series evaluated in the interval, $[-\pi,\pi]$, will not represent the function outside the interval
- the region outside the interval is called *the periodic extension*
- fourier series is periodic: 
$$f(x+2\pi) = f(x) = \frac{a_{0}}{2} + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}\cos(nx) +b_{n} \sin(nx) \right)$$
- eg: $f(x) = |x|$
