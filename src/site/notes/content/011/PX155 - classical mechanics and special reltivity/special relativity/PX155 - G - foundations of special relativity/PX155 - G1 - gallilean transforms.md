## statement
- "*the laws of mechanics are the same in all uniformly moving frames of reference.*"
- all velocity is relative, there is *no absolute velocity*, and *no universal definition of 'at rest'*, it depends on frames of reference
## galliean transformations (GTs)
- two frames ,$S$ and $S'$, in *standard configuration*

- origin of $S'$ moves at a speed, $\vec u$, in the x direction, along the x-axis of $S$
- two frames coincide at $t=0, x=x'$
- at $t>0$: an object stationary at position $x$ in $S$ has moved a distance $-ut$ in the $x'$ axis.
- *the galilean transformations*:
$$(x', \, y', \, z', \, t') = (x-ut, \, y, \, z, \, t)$$
- *event*: happens at a certain position at a certain time, $(x,y,z,t)$
## velocity addition

-  an object has velocity, $\vec v = (v_{x}' , v_{y}', v_{z}')$, in frame $S'$. what is $\vec v$ in frame $S$?
	- $v_{x}= \frac{dx}{dt}= \frac{d}{dt}(x'+ut') = \frac{dx'}{dt}+ u \frac{dt'}{dt} = \frac{dx'}{dt'} \frac{dt'}{dt} + u \frac{dt'}{dt}$
			$v_{x} = \frac{dx'}{dt'} +u$;
	- therefore, $v_{x}= v_{x}'+u$
$$(v_{x}, \, v_{y}, \, v_{z}) = (v_{x}'+u, \, v_{y}'+u , \, v_{z}'+u)$$
- same method is applied but different results are obtained in *special relativity*
