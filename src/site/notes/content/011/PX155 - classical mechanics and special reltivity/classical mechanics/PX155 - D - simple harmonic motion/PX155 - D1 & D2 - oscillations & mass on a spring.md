## oscillations
- occur when something is displaced and generates a force that opposes the displacement, ie: *restoring force*
- *SHM* is the simplest case 
## mass on a spring

- spring has a natural length when no force is exerted, $x=0$
- force on the mass due to spring $F=-kx$

		$a=\ddot x=\frac{-k}{m}x$
		rewritten as: $\ddot x + \omega ^{2}x = 0$
