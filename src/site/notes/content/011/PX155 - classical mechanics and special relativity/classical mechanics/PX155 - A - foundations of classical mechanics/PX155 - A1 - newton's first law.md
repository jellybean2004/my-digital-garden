- newton's framework for *quantitatively* understanding a huge range of the physical world
- a few basic principles
- *experimentally* based

## first law
- *"every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted on by an external force"*
or
-*"a body moves at a constant velocity unless acted on by a force"*

- [N1] holds in "inertial frames of reference", i.e. not accelerating
