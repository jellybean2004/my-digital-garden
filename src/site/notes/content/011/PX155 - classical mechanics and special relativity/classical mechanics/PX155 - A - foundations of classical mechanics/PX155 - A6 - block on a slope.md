- stationary block on a slope
![Pasted image 20231004141134.png](/img/user/pics/Pasted%20image%2020231004141134.png)
- stationary $\implies$ total vector force on the block = 0 by [[content/011/PX155 - classical mechanics and special relativity/classical mechanics/PX155 - A - foundations of classical mechanics/PX155 - A1 - newton's first law\|PX155 - A1 - newton's first law]]
- pick 2 directions parallel to the slope and perpendicular to the slope
		$\parallel \;:\; W \sin{\theta}$
		$\perp \;:\; W \cos{\theta}$
		$\implies F_s = N \tan{\theta}$
- here,
		$N - W \cos{\theta} = 0$
		$F_{s}-W\sin{\theta}=0$
- hence, for no slippage:
$$(F_s=W\sin{\theta})\leq (\mu _sN=\mu _sW\cos{\theta})$$
- dividing by $\cos{\theta}$:
$$\tan{\theta}\leq \mu _s$$
- $F_s$ has a max value of $\mu _s N$, so, it will reach $\theta _c$ at which block slips:
$$\tan{\theta _{c}}=\mu _s$$
	- easy way to measure $\mu _s$
