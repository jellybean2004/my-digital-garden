- **contact forces**: on macroscopic scale : a combination of *normal reaction* and *frictional* force
## static friction
 - *'free body diagram'* ![Pasted image 20231212140653.png](/img/user/pics/Pasted%20image%2020231212140653.png)
	 - vertically, there is no acceleration $\therefore N = W$ by [[content/011/PX155 - classical mechanics and special relativity/classical mechanics/PX155 - A - foundations of classical mechanics/PX155 - A1 - newton's first law\|PX155 - A1 - newton's first law]] ,  and
$$F=F_s$$
	- experimentally, static fiction can oppose $F$ up to some maximum value at which the point block accelerates
		- *Amonton's Law:*
$$max(F_s)=\mu _s N$$
				where, $\mu _s=$ coefficient of static friction
			- so, $F_s\leq \mu _s N$
				 $\mu _s \;steel/steel= 0.3$
				 $\mu _s \;teflon/teflon= 0.04$
				 $\mu _s \;rubber/rubber= 1.2$
## kinetic friction
- once in motion, friction is still roughly proportional to the normal force but the coefficient changes:
	- $F_k=\mu _k N$
		- $\mu _k=$ coefficient of kinetic/dynamic friction
- $\mu _k$ is usually less than $\mu _s$ (because if it is more, the resistance to motion will increase and it might not move) but they're usually similar in size
	- a force big enough to overcome $max(F_s)$ will be greater than $\mu _{k}N$ so, object that slips will keep slipping
