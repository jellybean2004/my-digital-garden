- a satellite of mass $m_s$ orbiting the earth
- gravity provides centripetal force, acts towards the centre of rotation of circular orbit
- angular momentum of satellite $L=I\omega = m_{s} R^{2}\omega$
- $F = \frac{GM_{E}m_{s}}{R^{2}}= m_{s} \frac{v^{2}}{R} \implies v = (\frac{GM_{E}}{R})^\frac{1}{2}$
- what torque does this generate?
	- $\vec \tau = \vec R \times \vec F = RF\sin\theta = 0 \;(\because\theta=\pi)$
- centripetal force generates no torque about $O$
- $\frac{d\vec L}{dt}= 0$ about $O$, $\therefore \vec L$ is conserved 
	- holds true for elliptical orbital as well
