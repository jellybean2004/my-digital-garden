- lever balances if $\frac{d\vec L}{dt}=0$
- ie: total $\vec\tau$ about $P=0$
- ![Pasted image 20231104151326.png](/img/user/pics/Pasted%20image%2020231104151326.png)
- zero torque if $r_{1}W_{1}=r_{2}W_{2}$ as per archimedes'
- conclusion: archimedes' lever equation is contained within [[content/011/PX155 - classical mechanics and special relativity/classical mechanics/PX155 - A - foundations of classical mechanics/A - foundations of classical mechanics\|A - foundations of classical mechanics]]
- torque:
$$\vec \tau = \vec r \times \vec F$$
- angular momentum:
$$\vec L = \vec r \times \vec p$$
torque:
$$\vec \tau = \frac{d\vec L}{dt}$$
