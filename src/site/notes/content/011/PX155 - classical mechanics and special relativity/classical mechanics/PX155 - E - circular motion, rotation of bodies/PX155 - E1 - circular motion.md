- start with a point mass moving in a circle at a constant speed

- definitions:
	- *centre of rotation*: centre of the circle described by the particle 
	- *plane of rotation*: the 2D plane in which the circle lies
	- *axis of rotation*: a line through the rotation through the centre of rotation and normal to the plane of rotation
- $s=r\theta$, so, speed $v= \frac{ds}{dt} = d\frac{r\theta}{dt} = r \frac{d\theta}{dt}$
- define $\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ as the angular speed in $rad.s^-1$
	- $v=\omega r$
- period is the time for one rotation: $P=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$
