- $\vec r$ is the vector from a moving the centre of rotation $C$ to a point of contact between the wheel and road
- velocity of P? $\implies \vec v_{p} = \vec u + (\vec \omega\times \vec r)$
- direction of $\vec \omega \times \vec r: \omega r(-\vec k \times -\vec j) = -\omega r \vec i$ 
- after one rolling rotation, $C$ has moved a distance of $2\pi r$ in time $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$
- so, $u = \frac{2\pi r}{\frac{2\pi}{\omega}}=r\omega$ 
- $v_{p} = r \omega \vec i + (\vec\omega \times \vec r) = r\omega \vec i - \omega r \vec i = 0$ 
- $v_{p}=0:$ point of contact instantaneously at rest - static friction is irrelevant
- if $\omega < \frac{u}{r}$, then kinetic friction applies
	- wheels of a car rotating at  $\omega < \frac{u}{r}$, they are under-rotating, which makes the car skid along the surface
	- if  $\omega > \frac{u}{r}$, wheels over-rotate and skid
