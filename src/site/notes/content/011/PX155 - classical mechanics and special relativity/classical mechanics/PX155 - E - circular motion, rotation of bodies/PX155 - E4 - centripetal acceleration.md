- vectors do not have position, so they can be drawn anywhere
- $\vec v$ is always perpendicular to $\vec r$
- $\vec r$ moves in a circle with angular speed $\omega, \; \therefore$ so does $\vec v$ 
- hence, if $v=\omega r$ (speed at which $\vec r$ rotates), $a=\omega v$ (speed at which $\vec v$ rotates) 
		$a=\omega v = \omega^{2}r$
		$a=\frac{v}{r} v=\frac{v^{2}}{r}$ 
	- $\vec a$ points in the $\hat {\vec r}$ direction towards $C$
- eg: draw forces and accelerations on a car driving in the circle at constant speed. find the maximum speed the car can go around in a circle with no skidding

	- centripetal acceleration is due to *static* friction between the tyres and the road

		- horizontally: $F = ma = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}$
		- vertically: $N = mg$
	- $F \leq \mu_{s}N$
		so, $\frac{mv^{2}}{r} \leq \mu_{s}mg$
	$$v \leq \sqrt{\mu_{s}gr}$$
- eg: $\mu_{s}=0.8$, $R=50m$ $\implies v \leq 19.9ms^-1(45mph)$
