- torque about $P:$
$$\tau = -Mg d\sin\theta$$
$$\tau = I_{p}\ddot \theta$$
- so,
$$-Mgd\sin\theta = I_{p}\ddot\theta$$
$$I_{P} = I_{cm} + Md^{2}$$
- for small $\theta: \sin\theta \approx \theta$
$$-Mgd\theta \approx  (I_{cm} + Md^{2})\ddot\theta$$
$$\ddot\theta \approx \frac{-Mgd}{I_{cm}+Md^{2}} \theta
$$
- SHM with $\omega^{2}= \frac{Mgd}{I_{cm}+Md^{2}}$, period$=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$
- to measure period - calculate $I_{cm}$ from experiment

- a circular disc, radius $20cm$, is separated from a  point $50m$ from its centre. what is the oscillation period as a compound pendulum?
