 - angular velocity vector $\vec\omega$ has magnitude $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ and direction parallel to the axis of rotation, sign according to the right hand rule
$$\vec v = \vec\omega \times \vec r$$
		where, $\vec r$ is a position vector relative to the origin on the axis of rotation
- why?

	- P moves in a circle of radius $r\sin\theta$, and has velocity $\omega r\sin\theta$ into the page
	- so as claimed, $\vec v=\vec \omega \times \vec r$
