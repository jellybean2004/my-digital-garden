- work performed per unit time
- measured in $Js^{-1}$ or $watts(W)$
- since $dW=\vec F .d\vec r$
$$\frac{dW}{dt}=\vec F \cdot  \frac{d\vec r}{dt}=\vec F \cdot \vec v$$
- eg: the "lorentz force" is a force that acts on a particle of charge $q$ as it moves through an electric field $\vec E$ and a magnetic field $\vec B$
$$\vec F = q(\vec E+ \vec v \times \vec B)$$
	- what is the rate of work done by $\vec F$
		$P = \frac{dW}{dt} = \vec F \cdot \vec v$
		$P = q \vec E \cdot \vec v +q (\vec v \times \vec B)\cdot \vec v$
		$P=q \vec E \cdot \vec v \implies \vec B-field$  does no work
