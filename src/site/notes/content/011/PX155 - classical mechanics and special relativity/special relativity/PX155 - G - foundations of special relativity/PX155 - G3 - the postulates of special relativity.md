## postulates
- einstein (1905) "on the electrodynamics of moving bodies" - foundation of **SR**
	- unknown whether einstein knew about the michelson-morley experiment
	- motivated by the contradictions between electromagnetism and relativity principle
- einstein started with 2 postulates:
{ #42001c}

	- ***RP1***: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames
		- just galilean invariance with 'physics' generalising 'mechanics'
		- 'solves' the problem with maxwell's equations: we aren't in a special frame; all frames measure $c$
		- inconsistent with galilean velocity addition
	- ***RP2***: the speed of light in empty space is the same in all inertial frames
