- consider a clock at rest in frame $S'$
- 2 subsequent ticks take place as events $A$ and $B$ with coordinates $x_{A}', t_{A}'$, and $x_{B}', t_{B}'$
- time coordinates in $S$?
		$t_{A} = \gamma (t_{A}' + \frac{ux_{A}'}{c^{2}})$
		$t_{B} = \gamma (t_{A}' + \frac{ux_{B}'}{c^{2}})$
	- at rest in $S'$, so $x_{A}' =x_{B}'$
	- so, $t_{B}-t_{A} = \gamma(t_{B}'-t_{A}')$
		- for a clock at rest in $S'$:
$$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t'$$
- time between ticks is dilated in frame where clock moves
- similarly, $\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t$ for a clock at rest in $S$
- define $\Delta t_0$ as "*proper time*" interval, ie: the interval between ticks in rest frame of the clock 
## atmospheric muons and time dialation
- rossi and hall (1941)
- cosmic rays hit the upper atmosphere and generate muons heading towards the ground at $\approx c$ 
- muons:
$$\mu^{-} \to e^{-} + \bar{\nu}{E} + \nu_{\mu}$$
- number of muons: ${} N = N_{0}e^{- \frac{t}{\tau}} {}$ with $\tau = 2.2 \mu s$
- measure downward flux at the top of a $600m$ mountain and again at the bottom
- expect
$$\frac{N}{N_{0}}= \exp\frac{-1600/c}{2.2\times10^{-6}} \approx 0.9$$
- instead measure $0.7$
