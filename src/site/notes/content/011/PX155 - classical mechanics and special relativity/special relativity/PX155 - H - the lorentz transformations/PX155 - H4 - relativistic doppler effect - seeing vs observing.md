- let $\Delta t_{0}$ be the proper time interval between each pulse from a light source
- in $S':$
$$\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t_0$$
- the source also moves a distance $u\Delta t':$
$$\begin{align*}
		\Delta t'_{u} &= \gamma\Delta t_{0}- \frac{u}{c} \gamma\Delta t_{0} \\
		&= \gamma\Delta t_{0}\left(1- \frac{u}{c}\right)\\
		\frac{1}{f'}&= \frac{\gamma}{f_{0}}\left(1- \frac{u}{c}\right) \\
		\frac{f'}{f_{0}}&= \frac{1}{\gamma\left(1- \frac{u}{c}\right)}
	\end{align*}$$
- if moving away:
$$\frac{f'}{f_{0}} = \frac{1}{\gamma\left(1+ \frac{u}{c}\right)}$$
- eg: a star, $SS433$, emits two jets of material at $0.26c$ in opposite directions. at what $\lambda$ will light be received from the two jets?
	- $\lambda_{0}=656.2nm$
	- $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.26^{2}}} = 1.0356$
	- receding jet: $\lambda = \gamma \left(1+ \frac{u}{c}\right)= 856.3 nm \to$ red shifted
	- approaching jet: $\lambda = \gamma\left(1 - \frac{u}{c}\right)= 502.9nm\to$ blue shifted
