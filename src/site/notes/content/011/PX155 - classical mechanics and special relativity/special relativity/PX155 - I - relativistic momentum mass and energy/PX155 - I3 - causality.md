- [[content/011/PX155 - classical mechanics and special relativity/special relativity/PX155 - H - the lorentz transformations/PX155 - H1 - lorentz transformation\|LTs]] can change the order of two events

- consider: $t' = \gamma (t - \frac{ux}{c^{2}})$
- two events separated by $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$:
$$\Delta t' = \gamma (\Delta t - \frac{u\Delta x}{c^{2}})$$
- if $\Delta t>0$, $\Delta t' >0$ if $\frac{u\Delta x}{c^{2}}< \Delta t$
- $LHS$ is maximized when $u \to c$
- events occur in some order if $\Delta x < c\Delta t$

- called *cause limits* because light could have travelled the distance between the events in the time between the events

- causality is lorentz invariant
