## introduction
- *flux* is the measure of 'flow' of $\vec E$ though a surface
- unit: $V \, m$

- consider a closed surface and move a test charge, $q_{0}$, in its vicinity. measuring the force felt by the charge, the $\vec E$ can be measured as:
$$
\vec E = \frac{\vec F}{q_{0}}
$$

| direction of $\vec E$ | charge inside volume | direction of electric flux |
|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|       outwards        |       positive       |          outwards          |
|        inwards        |       negative       |          inwards           |
## electric flux from a uniform surface

- for a uniform $\vec E$ across a flat surface of area $S$ :
$$
\phi_{E}= \vec E \cdot \vec S
$$
	where, $\vec S$ is a vector perpendicular to the surface, $|\vec S| = area_{surface}$, and $\vec E$ is evaluated on the surface and uniform across the surface
