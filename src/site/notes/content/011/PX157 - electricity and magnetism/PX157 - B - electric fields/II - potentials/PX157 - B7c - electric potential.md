- coulomb force $\vec F \to$ electric field $\vec E$:
$$
\vec E(\vec r) = \lim_{q_{0}\to0} \frac{\vec F_{q_{0}}}{q_0}
$$
- potential energy $U \to$ **electric potential**:
$$
V(\vec r) = \lim_{q_{0}\to0} \frac{ U_{q_{0}}}{q_{0}}
$$
- units: volt ($V = J\,C^{-1}$)

- scalar field defined at all points in space, even if no charge is present at that point
$$
\frac{W_{a\to b}}{q_{0}} = \frac{U_{a}}{q_{0}}- \frac{U_{b}}{q_{0}} = V_{a}- V_{b} \equiv V_{ab}
$$
- $V_{ab}$ is the potential difference, which represents work done by the electric field when unit charge moves from $a$ to $b$, or work that must be done to move a unit charge slowly from $b$ to $a$
- potential for a point charge, $q$, at position, $\vec r'$, measured at position, $\vec r$:
$$
V(\vec r) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}|\vec r -\vec r'|}
$$
