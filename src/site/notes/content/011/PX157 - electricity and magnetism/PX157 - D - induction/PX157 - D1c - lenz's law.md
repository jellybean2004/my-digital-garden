- the effect of an induced emf is such that it opposes the changing flux which produced it
- can be derived from [[content/011/PX157 - electricity and magnetism/PX157 - D - induction/PX157 - D1a - faraday's law\|faraday's law]], from the sign convention that determined the direction of the induced emf

- eg: for [[content/011/PX157 - electricity and magnetism/PX157 - D - induction/PX157 - D1b - a moving crossbar\|a moving crossbar]]

	- the motion of the crossbar increases $\phi_{B}$
	- the induced emf is clockwise
	- induced current is clockwise
	- [[content/011/PX157 - electricity and magnetism/PX157 - C - magnetic fields/PX157 - C4a - ampere's law\|ampere's law]] gives that the induced magnetic field is opposite to the original magnetic field
	- $|\vec B_{ind.}| < |\vec B _{ext.}|$ due to finite resistance
