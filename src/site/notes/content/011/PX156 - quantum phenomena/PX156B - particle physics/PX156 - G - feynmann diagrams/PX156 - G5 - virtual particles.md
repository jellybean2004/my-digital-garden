- consider a $\mu$ decay: 
$$\mu^{\pm} \to \bar\nu_{\mu}/\nu_{\mu} + e^{\pm} + \nu_{e}/\bar\nu_{e}$$

- the mass of the initial and final state particles are well defined

- real particles: $E^{2}= p^{2}c^{2}+ m^{2}c^{4}$
- but internal particles: $E^{2}\neq p^{2}c^{2}+ m^{2}c^{4}$
- internal lines can have any mass needed to conserve energy/momentum at each vertex
- internal particles are called *virtual particles*, and they do not conserve mass-energy-momentum
- sometimes called *propagators*
- these are never observed

- the proper language for particle interactions is ***quantum field theory***
- particles are localized waves in particle fields
- quantum number exchange occurs when the waves overlap
- particles are propagating wave packets
- when two electrons superpose, a disturbance is seen in the W-field, which is not self-propagating, and doesn't have a well defined mass
