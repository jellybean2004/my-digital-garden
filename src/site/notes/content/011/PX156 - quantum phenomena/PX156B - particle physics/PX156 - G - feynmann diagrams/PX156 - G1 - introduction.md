- the probability of a process to occur in particle physics is frequently difficult to calculate
- feynmann diagrams were designed to make the calculation easier
- each element is associated with a particular mathematical term
- a feynmann diagram can be viewed on two levels:
	- mathematical calculation
	- a cartoon of what is going on in an interaction

- a diagram represents a complex number which tells the probability of transitioning from a given initial state to a final state
- this number is called the *amplitude* or the *matrix element*: 
$$A(M)(i\to f)$$
- the probability: 
$$P(i\to f)= |A(i\to f)|^{2}$$
- if there are multiple routes for $i \to f$, then all routes must be accounted for in the probability: 
$$P(i\to f) = \left| \sum\limits_{t}A(i\to t\to f) \right|^{2}$$
## anatomy of a feynmann diagram
- consider a decay: 
$$A\to B+C+D$$

- the middle part will contain every way to go from $A$ to $B+C+D$ consisted with conservation laws
- terminology: 
	- the lines representing A, B, C, D are '*external lines*', and represent real particles
	- lines in the middle are '*internal lines*', and represent the transfer of quantum numbers and energy

- straight line pointing in $+ve$ time direction: *fermion*
- straight line pointing in ${} -ve$ time direction: *anti fermion*
- wavy line: photon
- wavy line: $W^\pm$ boson
- dashed line: $Z^{0}$, $H$
- wiggly/springy line: *gluon*
