- [[content/011/PX155 - classical mechanics and special reltivity/special relativity/PX155 - I - relativistic momentum mass and energy/I - relativistic momentum, mass, and energy\|energy-momentum equation for relativistic particles]]: 
$$E^{2}= (pc)^{2} + (mc^{2})^{2}$$
	- where,
		$E=$ total energy
		$p=$ momentum
		$m=$ *rest* mass
		$c=$ speed of light
	
- here, $p$ and $m$ can be written in terms of *energy equivalents*
	- mass: $eV/c^{2}$
	- momentum: $eV/c$
- to distinguish momentum from mass, the power of $c$ is tracked

- $m_{p}= 1.67\times10^{-27}\,kg:$ energy equivalent of this mass is $m_{p}c^{2}=1.5\times10^{-10}\,J$ 
- $eV$ is preferred
- $1\,eV\equiv$ energy gained by an electron as it moves through a potential difference of $1\,V \equiv 1.602\times10^{-19}\,J$
- in $eV: m_{p}c^{2}= 938\times10^{6}\,eV =938\, MeV \implies m_{p}= 938\,MeV/c^{2}$
