- AKA ***LINACs**
- accelerates particles in a single direction
- no magnetic field needed
- array of accelerating structures
- usually radiofrequency (RF) resonating cavities using RF power to create the electric field
- synchronizing the particle as it speeds up with the right phase of the RF is the trick

## benefits
- easy to build
- can accelerate electrons to reasonable energies ($\sim GeV$) without power loss
## drawbacks
- don't get to high energy without lots of acceleration $\implies$ long
- long $\implies$ lots of land
- diminishing returns for relativistic speeds $\implies$ can't go to very high energies
