- according to spins, fermion and bosons are distinguished

## fermions
- have spins of $\frac{\hbar}{2}, \frac{3\hbar}{2}, \frac{5\hbar}{2}, \dots$

- three *generations/families*
- each generation is a higher mass copy of the preceding one

- the types of fermions are known as *flavours*

- each fermion also has an associated *anti-particle*, with the same mass but opposite electric charge
- further split into two classes

- make up the nuclei
- generally feel all the [[content/011/PX156 - quantum phenomena/PX156B - particle physics/PX156 - E - introduction/PX156 - E2 - forces\|forces]]
- can never be seen alone outside a nucleus - "confined in the nucleus prison"
### [[content/011/PX156 - quantum phenomena/PX156B - particle physics/PX156 - F - the particle zoo/PX156 - F3 - leptons\|leptons]]
- involved in destruction
- feel weak and electromagnetic forces (not neutrinos)
- do not feel the strong force

- two types:
	- electrically charged: electron, muon, tau
	- electrically neutral: electron, muon and tau *neutrinos*
## bosons
- have spins of $0\hbar, 1\hbar, 2\hbar$
- force carriers
- heavier a boson, the shorter its range
### gauge bosons
#### gluon
- carriers of the strong force
#### photon
- carriers of the EM force
#### z boson
- neutral carriers of the weak force 
#### w boson
- electrically charged carriers of the weak force ($W^{\pm}$)
- carry a weak isospin of $T_{W}= \pm 1$, therefore an interaction with W boson changes $T_{W}$ by $\pm1$
### higgs bosons
- couples to/creates mass for particles
