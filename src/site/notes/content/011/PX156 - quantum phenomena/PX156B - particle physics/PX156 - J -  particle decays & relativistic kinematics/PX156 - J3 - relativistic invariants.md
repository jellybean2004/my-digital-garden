- for collisions, the reference frames will differ
- so, predictions and measurements will need to be translated by [[content/011/PX155 - classical mechanics and special relativity/special relativity/PX155 - H - the lorentz transformations/PX155 - H1 - lorentz transformation\|lorentz transformations]]
- use only quantities that are *invariant*, ie: same value in every inertial reference frame

- special relativity is based on invariance of some quantities:
	- speed of light
	- space-time interval
		- suppose there are two events, $A(x_{A},y_{A},z_{A}, ct_{A})$ and $B(x_{B},y_{B},z_{B}, ct_{B})$
		- space-time interval, $I$, has the same value in every frame, where: 
		$$I = (x_{A}-x_{B})^{2} + (y_{A}-y_{B})^{2} + (z_{A}-z_{B})^{2} - c^{2}(t_{A}-t_{B})^{2}$$
	- $E^{2}-p^{2}c^{2}=m^{2}c^{4}$

- cannot talk about the same things in different frames
- use invariants to connect reference frames
