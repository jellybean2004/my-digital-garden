## Â waves, wave fronts, and rays
![Pasted image 20231207110556.png](/img/user/pics/Pasted%20image%2020231207110556.png)
-  *rays*: show the direction of propagation at $90\degree$ to the wavefronts
## light in matter: refractive index
- light travels though matter via a continual process of scattering by the electrons in the material
	- the scattering of the wavefronts produces "wavelets" which sum to create the new wavefront. hence, the light propagates through the material
	- the scattering process effectively slows the light down
- the refractive index, $n$, is defined as as: 
$$n= \frac{c}{v}$$
		where, $v=$ speed of light in the material (phase velocity)
- eg: 

| material                     | $n$                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| glass                        | $1.5$                 |
| diamond                      | $2.5$                 |
| water                        | $1.3$                 |
| air                          | $1.0000296 \approx 1$ |
| "*bose-einstein condensate*" | $1.76 \times 10^{7}$  |
| aluminium (x-ray)            | $0.9999972$           |

- for bose-einstein condensate, $v=17$
- for aluminium, and in real situations, group velocity is what matters and $v_{g}<c$
