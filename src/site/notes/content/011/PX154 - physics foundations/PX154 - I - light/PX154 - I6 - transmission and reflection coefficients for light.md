- only normal incidence will be considered (ie: $\theta_{i}=0\degree$), and polarization neglected
- for *[[content/011/PX154 - physics foundations/PX154 - H - waves at boundaries/PX154 - H2 - two strings joined together - transmission and reflection\|waves on joined strings]]* , the amplitudes: if $\mu_{1}<\mu_{2}$ , the reflected wave was inverted
- here, intensities will be considered: [YF eqn 32.4] 
$$I=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}cE^{2}$$
		where, $E =$ E-filed amplitude
- transmission and reflection coefficients can be defined: 
$$T = \frac{4n_{i}n_{t}}{(n_{i}+n_{t})^{2}} \; and \; R = \frac{(n_{i}-n_{t})^{2}}{(n_{i}+n_{t})^{2}}$$
- eg: for $air\to glass: T=0.96 ,\; R=0.04$
	- when light leaves the glass, the same result is obtained
	- for a sheet of glass with two surfaces: $T=0.92$

- eg: diamond:
	- air $: n=1$, diamond $:n=2.4 \implies T=0.83$

- eg: $air(n=1)\to glass(n=1.5)\to diamond(n=2.4)$
	- $T_{air\to glass}=0.96$, $T_{glass \to diamond}=0.95$
	- total transmission, $T = 0.96 \times 0.95 = 0.91$
		- transmission is increased by using a material of intermediate refractive index (eg: $n_{i}=n_{t}\implies T=1$)
			- vital in optics
			- concept of "*impedance matching*"
