 - in fig 5.1, E-field is put along the y-axis
	 - in reality, it can point anywhere along the y-z plane for a wave travelling along $x$
	 - B-field is ignored in fig 5.2 ![Pasted image 20231205143623.png](/img/user/pics/Pasted%20image%2020231205143623.png)
	 -  the components of the $\vec E$-field are resolved: 
	 $$\vec E(x,t) = E_{y}\vec j + E_{z}\vec k$$
		 - eg: 
		 $$E_{y}= E_{0y} \cos(kx-\omega t)$$
		 $$E_{z}= E_{0z} \cos(kx-\omega t)$$
		 - fig 5.2 shows a wave oscillating at $45\degree$ between $y+z$
 - need to be able to have a phase difference between the components of the field: 
 $$E_{z}(x,t) = E_{0z}\cos(kx-\omega t + \phi)$$
 
	 - if $\phi=0$: fig 5.2 - linear polarization
	 - if $\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}$: fig 5.3 - circular polarization ![Pasted image 20231205143734.png](/img/user/pics/Pasted%20image%2020231205143734.png)
		 - magnitude of E-field is constant
		 - the E-field vector direction rotates around the x-axis, describing a helix
		 - left + right polarization for $\phi=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$
			 - different textbooks use opposite conventions for left + right polarization
		 - this is a special case of electrical polarization: when $E_{0y} \neq E_{0z}$ , or, if $\pi \neq \frac{\pi}{2}$
