## formula and convention
- *Clausius convention*:
$$\Delta U = Q - W$$
		where,
			$\Delta U =$ change in internal energy of the system
			$Q =$ heat input into the system
			$W =$ work done *by* the system
			note *negative sign*
	- cases:
		- for $Q$
			- $Q>0:$ heat input into the system
			- $Q<0:$ heat output by the system
		- for $W$
			- $W>0:$ work done *by* the system
			- $W<0:$ work done *on* the system

- *international physical chemistry convention*: 
$$\Delta U = Q + W$$
		here, $W>0:$ work done *on* the system
	- opposite sign convention
## internal energy (U)
- $U$ may not be known precisely, but only $\Delta U$ is used in the first law
- eg: for a monatomic gas: $U=K_{tr}= \frac{3}{2}nRT$
- $U$ only depends on the temperature of the gas, not its pressure or volume
