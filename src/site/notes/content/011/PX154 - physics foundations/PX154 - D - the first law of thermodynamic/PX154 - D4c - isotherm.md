- since $T$ is constant: 
$$\Delta U = Q - W = 0$$
- heat absorbed by the system does work that doesn't increase the system's temperature
- work done: $W = \int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} p.dV$
	- *[[content/011/PX154 - physics foundations/PX154 - C - thermal physics 2/PX154 - C1 - ideal gas equation of state#^b45b14\|from here]]*: $p= \frac{nRT}{V}$: 
$$\begin{align*}
	W &= \int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} \frac{nRT}{V}.dV \\
	\therefore W &= nRT \ln \left[{\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}} \right]
\end{align*}$$
