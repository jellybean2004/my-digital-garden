- **TLDR:**
	- two waves of the same amplitude with frequencies, $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$, such that $\Delta f=|f_{1}-f_{2}|$ is small
	- resultant amplitude varies with time, oscillating between constructive and destructive interference $\implies$ beat
	- frequency of beat $=\Delta f$
	- frequency heard $=\frac{f_{1}+f_{2}}{2}$

- two waves of the same speed, $c$, with frequencies, $(\omega+ \Delta \omega)$ and $(\omega - \Delta \omega)$, and wave numbers, $(k+\Delta k)$ and $(k - \Delta k)$, where $\Delta \omega$ and $\Delta k$ are small compared to $\omega$ and $k$
- adding them together: $u_{total}= u_{1}+u_{2}$
- using trig identity in equation $[3]$: 
$$u_{total} = 2A \cos (kx-\omega t) \cos (\Delta kx - \Delta \omega t)$$
- here, the two $\cos$ components are two travelling waves with frequencies $\omega$ and $\Delta \omega$, multiplied together

	$\omega = 2 \pi f$, with $f=25Hz$, $\Delta f = 1Hz$
	$f_{u_{1}} = 26Hz$; $f_{u_{2}} = 24Hz$
- a *beat pattern* is formed
- **furtherreading** [onlinetonegenerator.com], videos of beats
- in a complete cycle of $\Delta f$, beats are heard with a frequency of $2\Delta f$
- volume of beat pattern modulated at $2Hz$

- eg: two pianos at $258Hz$, and $254Hz$
		$f = 256Hz; \; \Delta f = 2Hz$
	- $f$ is the frequency heard
	- $\Delta f$ is the amplitude modulated at $2 \Delta f = 4Hz \implies$  *beat frequency*
