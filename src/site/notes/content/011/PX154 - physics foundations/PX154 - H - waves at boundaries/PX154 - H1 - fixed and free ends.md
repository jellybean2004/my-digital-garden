[YF 15.6]

## fixed end
- wave is reflected when it reaches the ends
- we are considering that the wave energy is reflected at the ends

- eg:
	- boundary condition: an end fixed at $y=0$
	- reflected wave is inverted
	- boundary condition: $y_{total}(x_{0})=0$ 
## free ends
- eg: 
	- organ pipe - wave reflected at the open end
	- sound waves echoing off a wall
	- light reflecting off a mirror
	- QM treatment of particles in a potential well
- eg:
	- frictionless ring, free to move along $y$
	- consider the ring to be massless
	- comparing it with the equation for a ring with mass, $m$, from the waves worksheet, we find the boundary condition to be: 
	$$\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)_{x_{0}} =0$$
