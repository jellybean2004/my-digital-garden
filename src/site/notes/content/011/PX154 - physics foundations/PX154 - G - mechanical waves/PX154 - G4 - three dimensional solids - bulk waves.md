- in solids, we need to consider both compressional (longitudinal) waves, and shear (transverse) waves
- now, we use the bulk modulus: $-V \frac{\partial p}{\partial V}$, where $V= volume$, $p = pressure$ [YF fig 11.17]
- we can consider two wave speed: 
	- compressive waves (often called "*p waves*"): 
	$$v_{p} = \sqrt{\frac{B+\frac{4G}{3}}{\rho}}$$
	- shear waves (often called "*s-waves*"): 
	$$v_{s} = \sqrt{\frac{G}{\rho}}$$
		- do not travel through liquids
- eg: for earth, $B = 105GPa$, $B=5GPa$ ("typical")
		$v_{p} = 7.7\times10^{4}m^{-1}$
		$v_{s}= 4.3\times10^{3}ms^{-1}$
- determined earth's internal structure by studying waves - further: [[PX399\|PX399]] *the earth an its atmosphere*
