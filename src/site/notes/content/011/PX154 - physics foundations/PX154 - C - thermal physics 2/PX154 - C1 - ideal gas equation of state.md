## ideal gas law
$$pV=nRT$$
	$p=$ pressure
	$V=$ volume
	$n=$ number of moles
	$R=8.31JK^{-1}mol^{-1}$ (gas constant)
	$T=$ temperature
$$pV=Nk_BT$$
	$N=$ number of atoms/molecules
	$k_B=1.38\times 10^{-23}JK^{-1}$ (boltzmann constant)

- works well in many situations:
	- high temperatures
	- low pressures
	- low density $(n/V)$
