## prediction
[YF 18.4]
![Pasted image 20231101093813.png](/img/user/pics/Pasted%20image%2020231101093813.png)
- atoms may vibrate in 3D
	- each direction contributes $k_{B}T$ per atom
- $\frac{1}{2}k_{B}T$ each from the $KE$ and the $PE$
- so, for 3D (x, y, z), $\implies total \; 3k_{B}T$
- so, per mole $C_{V}=3R = 24.9 Jm^{-1}K^-1$
	- *the rule of Dulong and Petit*

- experimental heat capacities *approach the prediction at high $T$*
- $C_{V}$ *drops at low $T$* as modes of vibration are *frozen out*
