- 3 phases separated by phase boundaries
- at the *triple point*, where the phase boundaries meet, *all three phases coexist*
- there is *no liquid phase below* the pressure of the triple point, and *solid sublimes into the gas*
	- eg: 
		- $CO_2$ "dry ice": $T_{tr}=216.1K;\;P_{tr}=527kPa\sim 5.2atm$
		- $H_2O: T_{tr}=273.16K;\;P_{tr}=611kPa$
- there is *always a phase boundary between solid and liquid at the highest pressure* studied
- gas liquid phase boundary ends at the *critical point*
- no distinction between gas and liquid at temperatures/pressures above this
