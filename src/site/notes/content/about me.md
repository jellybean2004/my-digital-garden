# hello!
## नमस्ते | 𑐖𑑂𑐰𑐖𑐮𑐥𑐵 | नमस्कार | Hallo | Bonjour |  السلام علیکم

welcome to my webpage! :)

i am a physics student at the university of warwick, currently in the second year of my undergraduate degree. i hail from the cradle of the himalayas, kathmandu, but i am currently in the armpit of europe, coventry.

inquisitive, determined, and silly - that's how i like to think of myself. i love learning about stuff - from the smallest particles in the universe and their queer behaviours, to the largest blackholes and spellbinding galaxies! but not just limited to that; i engage myself in learning from a plethora of disciplines: philosphy, psychology, history, architecture, urban planning, to name a few. but i would not deign to call myself well-learned in any of them. i just love delving deep into rabbit holes - from youtube videos, to wikipedia articles, and books if my interest still survives that.

other than that, you will mostly find me being chronically online. often, you will catch me snugged in my bed with a book in hand. i love reading fiction - especially books that delve into human life, emotions and hardships. i also like to write - usually poems, occasionally prose. i love listening to music, although i have no musical talent other than making playlists. it helps me get into different moods: from energetic to deep wallowing. i also love travelling, but never had the finances to support that. 

the field of physics i find myself most interested in is cosmology. it is incredibly hard, but i love the beauty it enshrines. i also highly enjoy astrophysics and particle physics. i am still on the fence about where i would like to go; perhaps it is not even physics!  publishing my university notes is one of the projects i started in year 2; do check out [[content/the green house\|my digital garden]].

an interesting fact about is is that i know quite a few languages. the reason i hesitate to state a number is because i am not proficient in all of them. my native tongue is nepali, but i would consider myself more fluent in english. i picked up hindi, urdu and newari along the way from tv and my parents, but i am not confident in conversing in them. i can read hindi, as it is written using the same letters as nepali, but not newari and urdu. i am currently learning french... on duolingo.... yah, not as impressive, but ask me how long my streak is! although i highly doubt that i will ever be able to understand people speaking the language, unless i relocate to a francophone country. i was also learning dutch a while ago, and if you speak it reeeally slowly,  exclusively using basic words, there is a high likelyhood of me getting you. once upon a time, i also tried learning danish, but it didn't go very far.

that's about it really...
