# hello!
## नमस्ते | 𑐖𑑂𑐰𑐖𑐮𑐥𑐵 | नमस्कार | bonjour | hallo |  السلام علیکم

>[!tip] welcome to my digital home! :)

i am an undergraduate physics scholar at the university of warwick, hailing from the cradle of the himalayas, kathmandu. inquisitive, determined, and silly - that's how i like to think of myself. i love learning about stuff - fascinated by the smallest particles in the universe and their queer behaviours, to the largest black holes and spellbinding galaxies and how they evolved over time! but my interest is not limited to just that; i engage myself in a plethora of disciplines: philosophy, psychology, history, architecture, urban planning, to name a few, but i would not deign to call myself well-learned in any of them. i enjoy delving deep into rabbit holes - from youtube videos, to wikipedia articles, and books if my interest still survives that.

other than that, you will mostly find me being chronically online. or, you will catch me snugged in my bed with a book in hand. i love reading fiction - especially books that delve into human life, emotions and hardships. i am also getting back into writing - mostly poems, occasionally prose. i love listening to music, although i have no musical talent other than making playlists, which is another hobby of mine. it helps me get into different moods: from energetic to deep wallowing. i also love travelling, but unfortunately i never had the finances to support that. 

the field of physics i find myself most interested in is cosmology. it is incredibly tough, but i love the beauty it enshrines. i also highly enjoy astrophysics and particle physics. i am still on the fence about where i would like to go; perhaps not even physics!  publishing my university notes is one of the projects i started in year 2; do check out [[content/the green house\|my digital garden]].

an interesting fact about is is that i know quite a few languages, as is expected from someone coming from my part of the world. i hesitate to state a number because i am not proficient in all of them. my native tongue is nepali, but i would consider myself more fluent in english. i picked up hindi and urdu from tv and movies, and newari along the way from my family, but i am not confident in conversing in them. i can read hindi, as it is uses the same writing system as nepali, but not newari and urdu. i am currently learning french... on duolingo.... yah, not as impressive, but ask me how long my streak is! i highly doubt that i will ever be able to understand people speaking the language, unless i relocate to a francophone country. i was also learning dutch a while ago. if you speak it reeeally slowly and exclusively using basic words, there is a high likelihood of me getting you. once upon a time, i also tried learning danish, but it didn't go very far.

that's about it really...
