## EM-radiation 
- historically, just em-radiation from stars were observed
- different wavelengths, $\lambda$, convey different information
- most telescopes are optical or radio as the atmosphere blocks out the other parts of the spectrum
- for UV, IR, etc, space telescopes are used
- earth's atmosphere, primarily $H_{2}O$, $CO_{2}$, absorbs large windows of wavelengths
- the wavelengths absorbed by the atmosphere

## non-EM-radiation
- gravitational waves
- neutrinos
- direct study
