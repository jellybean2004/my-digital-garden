- a helium core and a hydrogen-burning shell
- core exhausted hydrogen first as it has a higher temperature
- the shell feeds the core with helium
- core grows until thermal pressure cannot support it
- the core is inert and isothermal with no luminosity coming out of it
- from [[content/012/PX282 - stars and the solar system/E - stellar evolution/PX282 - E3 - main sequence#^4635d4\|here]], it is known that $L \propto \frac{dT}{dr} \implies \frac{dT}{dr} = 0:$ isothermal
- eventually, the core collapses and becomes degenerate, triggering the red giant branch
- **note:** if ${} M>2\,M_{odot} {}$, $He$ can fuse before degeneracy
## red giant branch (RGB)
- core contracts from increased mass and the envelope expands, so gravitational potential energy is being dumped into the envelope
- the temperatures of the core and the shell are increasing
- it is known that: 
$$L = 4\pi R^{2}\sigma T_{eff}^{4}$$
- $L$ is set by fusion
- $R$ is increasing
- $T_{eff}$ is decreasing
- the envelope becomes convective with a higher gradient: hot core to colder outer
- at the end of the RGB, the core gets hot enough for He fusion
- so, there is He-burning core, enveloped by a He-shell, enveloped by a H-burning core, enveloped by a H-shell: an onion!
## helium flash
- this happens if the mass of a star is more than $2\,M_{\odot}$
- the core is degenerate with no regulation and runaway fusion
- He-fusion ignites core in a few seconds
- fusion is a $3\alpha$ process (He $\to$ C + O)
- the energy released is comparable to a galaxy, but is mostly absorbed by outer layers
- ends when degeneracy is lifted
