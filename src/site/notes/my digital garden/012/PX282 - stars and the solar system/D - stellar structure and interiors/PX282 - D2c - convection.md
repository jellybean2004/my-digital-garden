- happens from the physical movement of materials
$$\begin{align*}
	\text{material: } \rho_{1}, T_{1} \to \rho_{a},T_{a} \\
	\text{bubble: } \rho_{1}, T_{1} \to \rho_{2},T_{2}	
\end{align*}$$
- consider a bubble of gas rising
- the bubble moves slowly, and *adiabatically* (no energy exchange with the environment)
- as it rises, the background density and temperature decrease
- this causes the bubble to expand, hence changing its density and temperature
- the outcome: $\rho_{2} > \rho_{a} :$ stable, bubble falls back
- if the opposite happens, ie: $\rho_{2}<\rho_{a}:$ unstable, bubble keeps rising
- *the schwarzschild criterion* for stability: 
$$\left| \frac{d\ln T}{d\ln P} \right|_{ad} > \left| \frac{d\ln T}{d\ln P} \right|_{rad}$$
