 - need to find out what is the suitable representation of dynamical variables of he QM system
- dynamical variables: position, momentum, energy, etc
- in classical physics, these are represented by algebraic variables: ${} x$, $p_x$, $E$, which can have all possible (continuous) values
- in QM, only some values are allowed, which needs to work together with the wavefunction to obtain information, so, something new, and different from classical physics is needed

## operators
- from [[content/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/B - introduction/PX262 - B2 - time independent schrödinger equation\|time independent schrödinger equation]]: 
$$\begin{gather*}
	\left[- \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2M} \vec\nabla^{2}+ V(\vec r)\right]\mu  = E\mu \\
	\hat H \mu = E \mu
\end{gather*}$$
	where, $\hat H$ is the hamiltonian (energy) operator
- a mathematical operator is an object which acts on a function and produces a new function, which need not be the same function
- in the above case, the same function is obtained
- the special cases are called eigenfunctions, and the values of $E$ are called eigenvalues:
	  $\hat H =$ operator
	  $\mu =$ eigenfunction
	  $E=$ eigenvalue
- eigenfunctions correspond to the single eigenvalue of the system
- if there is a system described by the eigenfunction of the given operator, and measurements of the corresponding variable is taken, the given eigenvalue is obtained
- it is reasonable to expect that if a second measurement is taken, the same answer is obtained
- if the measurement of a given value is obtained, the wavefunction immediately after the measurement should be the corresponding eigenfunction ($\phi_{n}$)

- the dynamical variables are represented by operators, and the eigenvalues of these operators correspond to the possible measurement outcomes
