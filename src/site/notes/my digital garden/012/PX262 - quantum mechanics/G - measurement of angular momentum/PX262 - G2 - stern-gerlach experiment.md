- interaction of the magnetic moment with an external magnetic field can be used to measure the orbital angular momentum
- taking a non-uniform magnetic field, and letting atoms pass through such field perpendicular to the page

- the atoms feel a force:
$$F = - \mu_{z} \frac{\partial B}{\partial z}$$
- the beam should split based on $\mu_{z}$
- using [[my digital garden/012/PX262 - quantum mechanics/C - the basic postulates/PX262 - C2c - postulates 2 & 3\|postulate 3]], the operator for the mangnetic moment can be given as:
$$\hat \mu_{z} = - \frac{e}{2m} \hat L_{z}$$
- for atoms with an electrons with an orbital quantum number, $l$, a split into $2l+1$ parts is expected
- experimentally, it was seen that a $l=1$ beam did not split into 3 parts but 4, and $l=0$ beam splits to 2
- to resolve this, an additional property of particles, called the **spin**, was introduced
- for electrons, spin is $1/2$ and can have two projections: $\pm 1/2$
- spin can take other values: $n, n/2$ (integer or half integer)

- in the experiment, the orbital angular momentum and spin should be added:
$$l = 1 \oplus s = \frac{1}{2}\implies [l+s, |l-s|] = 3/2,\;1/2$$
- the total angular momentum, $3/2$, there are 4 values for that $z$-projection
