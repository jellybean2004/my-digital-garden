- if two or more sides of the potential well are of the same length, eg: $a=b$, the energies of the states will be: 
  $$E_{n_{x}n_{y}n_{z}} = \frac{\hbar^{2}\pi^{2}}{8M} \left( \frac{n_{x}^{2}+n_{x}^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{n_{z}^{2}}{c^{2}} \right)$$
- in such cases, there will be several states with the same energy, ie. it is a **degenerate system**
- eg: ${} (n_{x}=1, n_{y}=2)$ and ${} (n_{x}=2, n_{y}=1)$ have the same energies but different corresponding eigenfunctions
- 3D systems exhibit such behaviour regularly
