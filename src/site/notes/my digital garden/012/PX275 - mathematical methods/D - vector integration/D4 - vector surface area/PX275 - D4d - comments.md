- for a closed curve (eg: the circular loop in the $x$-$y$ plane), the total vector surface area of any surface spanning curve is a property of the curve itself
- the shape of the surface is irrelevant
- a closed curve and an open surface have been considered
- if there is a closed surface (eg: a hemisphere with a base)
- the total vector surface area: 
$$\vec S_{2,top} = \vec S_{2,bottom} $$
