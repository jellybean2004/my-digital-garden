- considering a vector field, $\vec F$, describing a volume of rain falling per second, per unit area
- taking the dimensions of the rain falling vertically, ie: $\sim - \hat k$

- to determine how much flux will go through a loop
- the total flux through the loop is: $\vec F \cdot \hat n \, A$, where, $\hat n$ is the normal vector to the surface area, $A$, defined by the loop
- it will be maximized for $\vec F \parallel \hat n$, and minimized (zero) for $\vec F \perp \hat n$
